He is the only child of Alan George &lt;unk&gt;, a literary agent, and Marcia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( n&lt;unk&gt;e Marcia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;acobson &lt;unk&gt;, a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector &lt;unk&gt; Mysteries and Walk Away and I &lt;unk&gt;. His father, who was raised in &lt;unk&gt;, County Down, Northern Ireland, is from &lt;unk&gt; a very working &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class &lt;unk&gt; Protestant background. His mother is &lt;unk&gt;ewish, and was born in South Africa and raised in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Sea, Essex. Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parents had both acted as children. In a &lt;unk&gt; interview, &lt;unk&gt; stated : &lt;unk&gt; There was never &lt;unk&gt; religious &lt;unk&gt; faith in the house. I think of myself as being &lt;unk&gt;ewish and Irish, despite the fact that I &lt;unk&gt;m English. &lt;unk&gt; He has stated : &lt;unk&gt; We were Christmas tree &lt;unk&gt;ews &lt;unk&gt;, and that he is &lt;unk&gt; very proud of being &lt;unk&gt;ewish &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; first expressed a desire to act at the age of five, and in December &lt;unk&gt;, aged &lt;unk&gt;, he made his acting debut in BBC One &lt;unk&gt;s televised two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at two independent schools for boys : Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London &lt;unk&gt;s financial district ( known as the City of London &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; school became difficult for &lt;unk&gt; after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to &lt;unk&gt; have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt; rather than jealousy. As his acting career began to consume his schedule, &lt;unk&gt; continued his education through on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work &lt;unk&gt; really difficult. &lt;unk&gt; He achieved A grades in the three &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level exams that he took in &lt;unk&gt;, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;, they &lt;unk&gt;d love it, &lt;unk&gt; he told Details magazine in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; If there were any parties going on, they &lt;unk&gt;d be tipped off as to where they were. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, producer David &lt;unk&gt; asked &lt;unk&gt; to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone, the best &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; selling book by British author &lt;unk&gt;. K. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had been searching for an unknown British actor to &lt;unk&gt; the character, and the movie &lt;unk&gt;s director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, &lt;unk&gt; This is what I want. This is Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt;, after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, and after several auditions, &lt;unk&gt; was selected to play the part. &lt;unk&gt; also endorsed the selection saying, &lt;unk&gt; I don &lt;unk&gt;t think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered &lt;unk&gt; a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; movie contract with shooting in the &lt;unk&gt;K ; &lt;unk&gt; was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that. The release of Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; took place in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; received a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was &lt;unk&gt; not that important &lt;unk&gt; to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the embodiment of every reader &lt;unk&gt;s imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing, &lt;unk&gt; wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle. A year later &lt;unk&gt; starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of &lt;unk&gt;, the second installment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors &lt;unk&gt; performances but had &lt;unk&gt; opinions on the movie as a whole. The &lt;unk&gt; release Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; was the third film in the series. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; of Fire in &lt;unk&gt;. The film was the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and &lt;unk&gt; singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie &lt;unk&gt;s creative success. The future of the franchise was put into question when &lt;unk&gt; and his co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; leads Emma Watson and Rupert &lt;unk&gt; hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes ; however, by March &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had signed for the final films, which put an end to weeks of press &lt;unk&gt; speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which he had performed nude on stage. &lt;unk&gt; reprised his role for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; stated that director David &lt;unk&gt; and actress &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made Order of the Phoenix the &lt;unk&gt; most fun &lt;unk&gt; film in the series to work on. His performance earned several award nominations, and he received the &lt;unk&gt; National Movie Award for &lt;unk&gt; Best Male Performance. &lt;unk&gt; As his fame and the series continued, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Watson left &lt;unk&gt; of their hands, feet, and &lt;unk&gt; in front of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; Harry Potter and the Half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Blood Prince was released, the series &lt;unk&gt; sixth instalment. &lt;unk&gt; received nominations for &lt;unk&gt; Best Male Performance &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Global &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; MT&lt;unk&gt; Movie Awards. For financial and &lt;unk&gt; reasons the last book was divided into two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series &lt;unk&gt; fanbase. &lt;unk&gt; defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more &lt;unk&gt;, focusing on character development ; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, &lt;unk&gt; openly &lt;unk&gt;. The final film, Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Part &lt;unk&gt;, was released in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, along with the film, was critically acclaimed : Ann &lt;unk&gt; of The Washington Post asked, &lt;unk&gt; Who could have predicted that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Watson would turn out to be good actors? &lt;unk&gt; ; similarly, Rex Reed said : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, I ’ m sorry to see &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; go &lt;unk&gt; ; while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Well played, sir. &lt;unk&gt; Roger &lt;unk&gt; gave the film a highly positive review, but felt that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Watson were &lt;unk&gt; upstaged by the supporting &lt;unk&gt; actors &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character, but also said he is &lt;unk&gt; proud to be associated with this film series forever. &lt;unk&gt; Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After &lt;unk&gt; hinted about writing an eighth book, &lt;unk&gt; was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; It is &lt;unk&gt; very doubtful. I think &lt;unk&gt; years is a long time to spend with one character. &lt;unk&gt; Despite &lt;unk&gt; so much time to the series, &lt;unk&gt; has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : &lt;unk&gt; I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made his film debut in The &lt;unk&gt; of Panama, an American &lt;unk&gt; film based on &lt;unk&gt;ohn le &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; spy novel, and a moderate commercial success.

In &lt;unk&gt; he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in &lt;unk&gt; and released to theatres in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;.

The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance as an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old who goes missing in action during a battle. &lt;unk&gt; stated, &lt;unk&gt; For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I &lt;unk&gt;ve always been fascinated by the subject and think it &lt;unk&gt;s as relevant today as it ever was. &lt;unk&gt; At age &lt;unk&gt;, in a bid to show people he was prepared for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer &lt;unk&gt;s play &lt;unk&gt;, which had not been revived since its first run in &lt;unk&gt;, at the Gielgud Theatre. &lt;unk&gt; took on the lead role as Alan &lt;unk&gt;, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, and the role generated significant pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; opening media interest, as &lt;unk&gt; appeared in a nude scene. &lt;unk&gt; opened on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; and ran until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he &lt;unk&gt; displays a dramatic power and an &lt;unk&gt; stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward. &lt;unk&gt; He added : &lt;unk&gt; I never thought I would find the &lt;unk&gt; ( but perfectly formed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a sinister figure, but as Alan &lt;unk&gt;... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion. &lt;unk&gt; The production then transferred to Broadway in September &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; still in the lead role. &lt;unk&gt; stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was nominated for a Drama &lt;unk&gt; Award. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; debuted as &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Finch in the &lt;unk&gt; Broadway revival How to &lt;unk&gt; in Business Without Really &lt;unk&gt;, a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert &lt;unk&gt; and Matthew &lt;unk&gt;.

Both the actor and production received favourable reviews, with &lt;unk&gt;SA Today commenting : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ultimately succeeds not by &lt;unk&gt; his fellow cast members, but by working in conscientious harmony with them &lt;unk&gt; and having a blast in the process. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance in the show earned him Drama &lt;unk&gt; Award, Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations. The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations. &lt;unk&gt; left the show on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;.

When the sheriff &lt;unk&gt; down production, Black &lt;unk&gt; that the killer may target the crew &lt;unk&gt;s hotel ; he and Hollis arrive to find the body of the film &lt;unk&gt;s publicist hanging from a rope. The next day, a film extra ( Gene Simmons &lt;unk&gt; confesses to the killings ; Black &lt;unk&gt; holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed &lt;unk&gt; and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their &lt;unk&gt; cut, while Winston &lt;unk&gt;s body hangs nearby in an apparent murder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; suicide. Black doubts that Winston is the killer, and while Hollis stays in the hotel, he visits the production &lt;unk&gt;s climactic shoot, set during a performance by the band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff &lt;unk&gt;s body is thrown down from the &lt;unk&gt; ; as the &lt;unk&gt; settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted &lt;unk&gt; the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis &lt;unk&gt; off a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; ; the actor then explains that he lacked Black &lt;unk&gt;s insight and had to commit the crimes in order to see through the eyes of a killer. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry, who had previously penned the second season episode &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and would provide a further three scripts in the third season. The episode was directed by Thomas &lt;unk&gt;. Wright, who helmed a total of twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; six episodes across all three seasons. Wright would also go on to direct &lt;unk&gt; Millennium &lt;unk&gt;, the series &lt;unk&gt; crossover episode with its sister show The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files. The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss &lt;unk&gt; Peter Criss, Ace &lt;unk&gt;, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley &lt;unk&gt; who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role. However, the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue, which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and &lt;unk&gt; updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode. Ace &lt;unk&gt; was also &lt;unk&gt; towards his role, and requested to play a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound black man &lt;unk&gt; instead, wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the &lt;unk&gt; Eddie Murphy film The &lt;unk&gt; Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to &lt;unk&gt;. Perry has described the production &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; as being &lt;unk&gt; one of the most &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the series &lt;unk&gt; run, citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this. Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints, as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode. Guest star &lt;unk&gt;eff &lt;unk&gt;, who played killer Mark Bianco, is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher, who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black &lt;unk&gt;s wife Catherine. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Broadcast and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; was first broadcast on the Fox network on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; during its original broadcast, meaning that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent of households in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States viewed the episode. This represented approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million households. &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from critics. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club &lt;unk&gt;s Todd &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff rated the episode a &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff felt that the episode &lt;unk&gt;s comedic &lt;unk&gt; was necessary within the wider series, as he considered Millennium &lt;unk&gt;s dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this. &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when &lt;unk&gt; the character of Frank Black, but admitted that it &lt;unk&gt; falls apart &lt;unk&gt; when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files, Millennium &lt;unk&gt; The Lone Gunmen, rated &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better, but that &lt;unk&gt; the whole concept drowns in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He considered the episode &lt;unk&gt;s characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss.  &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a species of &lt;unk&gt; lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is closely related to the American lobster, H. americanus. It may grow to a length of &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and a mass of &lt;unk&gt; kilograms ( &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;, and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life, the lobsters are blue, only becoming &lt;unk&gt; lobster red &lt;unk&gt; on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into &lt;unk&gt; larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is a large &lt;unk&gt;, with a body length up to &lt;unk&gt; centimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and weighing up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilograms ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;, although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; long and weigh &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;. Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard &lt;unk&gt; which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; years for larger animals. The first pair of &lt;unk&gt; is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of claws. The larger one is the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and has rounded &lt;unk&gt; used for crushing prey ; the other is the &lt;unk&gt; cutter &lt;unk&gt;, which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. &lt;unk&gt;sually, the left claw is the &lt;unk&gt;, and the right is the cutter. The &lt;unk&gt; is generally blue above, with spots that &lt;unk&gt;, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment &lt;unk&gt; is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : The &lt;unk&gt; of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Life cycle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently &lt;unk&gt; female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to &lt;unk&gt; months, depending on the temperature, attached to her &lt;unk&gt;. Females carrying eggs are said to be &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on &lt;unk&gt;. This stage involves three &lt;unk&gt; and lasts for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a &lt;unk&gt; lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only &lt;unk&gt; larva in every &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; survives to the &lt;unk&gt; phase. When they reach a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Distribution &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is found across the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, not including the Baltic Sea. It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west coast of the Black Sea. The &lt;unk&gt; populations are found in the Norwegian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, inside the Arctic Circle. The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment. The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway, which have been referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; midnight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sun lobster &lt;unk&gt;. The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the &lt;unk&gt; were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel. Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, Cancer &lt;unk&gt;. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, one million lobster larvae were released from &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, but the species did not become established there. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ecology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;, although not normally deeper than &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. They prefer hard substrates, such as rocks or hard mud, and live in holes or crevices, emerging at night to feed. The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other &lt;unk&gt; invertebrates. These include crabs, molluscs, sea &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and polychaete worms. The three &lt;unk&gt; lobster species Homarus gammarus, H. americanus and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are hosts to the three known species of the animal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described. Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease &lt;unk&gt;, caused by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Human consumption &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is traditionally &lt;unk&gt; highly esteemed &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; and was mentioned in &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain &lt;unk&gt; excellent &lt;unk&gt; white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the &lt;unk&gt; mill and the &lt;unk&gt; sand vein &lt;unk&gt; ( gut &lt;unk&gt;. The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus, and the European species is considered to have a better flavour. &lt;unk&gt; are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands &lt;unk&gt;. The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; systems for H. gammarus are under development, and production rates are still very low. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. That name was Cancer gammarus, since Linnaeus &lt;unk&gt; concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans. H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber, &lt;unk&gt;, as determined by Direction &lt;unk&gt; of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Edwards, &lt;unk&gt;, and also because Friedrich Weber &lt;unk&gt;s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary &lt;unk&gt;, rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Edwards, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; invalid for Homarus Weber, &lt;unk&gt;. The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a &lt;unk&gt; selected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. It came from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; N &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E, near &lt;unk&gt;, Sweden ( &lt;unk&gt; kilometres or &lt;unk&gt; miles northwest of Gothenburg &lt;unk&gt;, but both it and the &lt;unk&gt; have since been lost. The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is &lt;unk&gt; European lobster &lt;unk&gt;, but the species is also widely known as the &lt;unk&gt; common lobster &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; assassination plot &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; assassination plot was a conspiracy by a group of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking followers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( later known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to assassinate Charles Turner, the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;nited States Attorney for the District of Oregon. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s personal secretary and second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; Silverman &lt;unk&gt;, assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at &lt;unk&gt;. Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and &lt;unk&gt; marriages, and later headed the federal prosecution of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. The conspirators included : Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt;, Chief Financial Officer of &lt;unk&gt; ; Susan &lt;unk&gt;, head of security at &lt;unk&gt;, Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt;, who bought weapons and &lt;unk&gt; and volunteered to be the actual murderer ; Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy, fourth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command of &lt;unk&gt; ; and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conspirators Alma Potter, Carol Matthews, &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt;. The conspirators obtained false identification to purchase &lt;unk&gt; out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; state, &lt;unk&gt; Turner, and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland, Oregon. The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later, as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt; and other illegal acts by the &lt;unk&gt; leadership. Prosecution of the conspirators began in &lt;unk&gt;, when a federal grand jury brought &lt;unk&gt; against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and &lt;unk&gt; proceedings against the &lt;unk&gt; and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years. The final &lt;unk&gt; was convicted in &lt;unk&gt;, when Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; agreed to return to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight &lt;unk&gt; received sentences ranging from five years &lt;unk&gt; to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; was never &lt;unk&gt; in relation to the conspiracy, and left the &lt;unk&gt;nited States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to &lt;unk&gt; the country without permission from the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney General. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Planning &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hit list &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seven followers ( called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of charismatic leader &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( now known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were convicted of a &lt;unk&gt; conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional &lt;unk&gt; eighth member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The &lt;unk&gt; were high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking followers within the &lt;unk&gt; organization. &lt;unk&gt; in the case stated that the &lt;unk&gt; had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group &lt;unk&gt;s activities in &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. Turner &lt;unk&gt;s investigation focused on &lt;unk&gt; marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave &lt;unk&gt; was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner. In May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s personal secretary and second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, &lt;unk&gt; Silverman ( Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, gathered the leader &lt;unk&gt;s key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of Turner, as well as several dissidents among their organization. &lt;unk&gt; stated that Turner &lt;unk&gt;s grand jury investigation &lt;unk&gt; threatened the existence of the commune &lt;unk&gt;, and exposed &lt;unk&gt; and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution. &lt;unk&gt; hoped that by murdering Turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; leaders. Three former leaders of the commune including Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Yvonne &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a registered nurse from the Philippines who managed the &lt;unk&gt; medical corporation, and former treasurer of &lt;unk&gt; Foundation International and Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Australia, put together a hit list which included &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David &lt;unk&gt;. Susan &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma Anand Su &lt;unk&gt;, a top official in the &lt;unk&gt; hierarchy, was also a participant in the assassination conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; was in charge of the security force at &lt;unk&gt;, ran the &lt;unk&gt; Investment Corporation, and supervised construction on the commune. Other conspirators in the assassination plot included Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, president of the &lt;unk&gt; commune, and Alma Potter ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bodyguard and traveling companion. Potter was manager of the Hotel &lt;unk&gt; in Portland, Oregon, and a member of the commune &lt;unk&gt;s security force. The &lt;unk&gt; reported that nine people were on the hit list, including : Turner, &lt;unk&gt;, former assistant attorney general Karen H. Green, &lt;unk&gt; County planning director Daniel C. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; County commissioner &lt;unk&gt;ames L. &lt;unk&gt;, investigative journalist for The &lt;unk&gt; Leslie L. &lt;unk&gt;, former member Helen C. Byron ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who had been awarded &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in a lawsuit against &lt;unk&gt; Foundation International, her daughter Barbara &lt;unk&gt;. Byron ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former secretary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Weapons &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder Turner, and bought guns and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was known to fellow followers as Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and was also one of the three &lt;unk&gt; Big &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; ( known by followers as Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an &lt;unk&gt; and the group &lt;unk&gt;s Chief Financial Officer, provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell ( Ma Deva &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; described in a federal &lt;unk&gt; how members of the murder conspiracy obtained &lt;unk&gt;, referring to Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B went down to &lt;unk&gt;esus Grove, and &lt;unk&gt; gave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;esus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the &lt;unk&gt; commune resided, except for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; and three other &lt;unk&gt; followers traveled to New York in the spring of &lt;unk&gt; to acquire false identification. According to a federal &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns. Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase &lt;unk&gt;. Caldwell stated she and Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; flew to Texas to purchase guns there. They purchased five guns in Texas, but encountered difficulty purchasing &lt;unk&gt; in Texas with out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead. Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed &lt;unk&gt; not to come back without the guns &lt;unk&gt;. In New Mexico, they obtained false identification, and purchased several pistols. Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico : &lt;unk&gt; we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell said she and &lt;unk&gt; went to a university library to find the identity &lt;unk&gt; of someone dying very young &lt;unk&gt;, next went &lt;unk&gt; to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate &lt;unk&gt; and described how &lt;unk&gt; we got a rent &lt;unk&gt; book and just made up a rent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in &lt;unk&gt; with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets, &lt;unk&gt; said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; caliber revolver, and four &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; caliber Security &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Six Magnum &lt;unk&gt;. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a &lt;unk&gt; Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and &lt;unk&gt; traveled by bus back to the &lt;unk&gt; commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland, Oregon. They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner. &lt;unk&gt; follower Carol Matthews ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot, in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner. According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college &lt;unk&gt; of Turner &lt;unk&gt;s, and learned his car &lt;unk&gt;s license plate number and his parking location. Court records state that Matthews and an &lt;unk&gt; co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gave &lt;unk&gt; registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; survey on President Reagan &lt;unk&gt;s economic plan &lt;unk&gt;, in order to obtain Turner &lt;unk&gt;s route number and post office box number. The two tried repeating the story with members of the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Postal Service, but the postal officials did not give them Turner &lt;unk&gt;s address. They then drove around Turner &lt;unk&gt;s neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said &lt;unk&gt; Turner &lt;unk&gt;. Matthews had pictures of Turner &lt;unk&gt;s residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI &lt;unk&gt; during an investigation of the &lt;unk&gt; commune, and verified after being shown to Turner. Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner &lt;unk&gt;s office, home and car, and discussed methods to assassinate him, hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into &lt;unk&gt;. Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked, in Portland, Oregon, but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home. After spending multiple nights watching Turner &lt;unk&gt;s house, the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work, or in front of his home. Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry &lt;unk&gt; Plaza in Portland, Oregon. In an &lt;unk&gt; given to the FBI, &lt;unk&gt; Alma &lt;unk&gt; described how the &lt;unk&gt; decided on the federal parking garage as the location : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off. &lt;unk&gt; The conspirators practiced different ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. &lt;unk&gt; later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; if the plan was successful. According to The &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; were not carried out because Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; became distracted by political power plays within the &lt;unk&gt; commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Investigation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Congressman &lt;unk&gt;ames H. Weaver gave a speech in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States House of Representatives in which he asserted that the &lt;unk&gt; were involved in the &lt;unk&gt; attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a &lt;unk&gt;efferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement as a result of the ensuing investigation into activities at &lt;unk&gt;. Turner was never physically &lt;unk&gt;, and had retired by &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; was informed in October &lt;unk&gt; by federal law enforcement officials that Leslie L. &lt;unk&gt;, an investigative journalist who had written a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part series on the &lt;unk&gt; movement in Oregon, was on a &lt;unk&gt; hit list &lt;unk&gt; which also included Turner and Oregon Attorney General David &lt;unk&gt;. Assistant &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney Robert Weaver &lt;unk&gt; the case ; the charges were first detailed at an October &lt;unk&gt; bond hearing in North Carolina after &lt;unk&gt; and his followers were arrested at an airport in Charlotte. Weaver said in court that followers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had plotted to assassinate Turner and &lt;unk&gt;. He said these allegations were reasons why releasing &lt;unk&gt; and his followers from jail would be &lt;unk&gt; a clear and present danger to public officials &lt;unk&gt;. The guns purchased by the &lt;unk&gt; followers for the assassination plot had reportedly been dumped in a lake at Rancho &lt;unk&gt; ; the lake was searched by &lt;unk&gt;.S. Navy divers. &lt;unk&gt; divers searched the lake for two days but did not find the guns. &lt;unk&gt;oseph Greene, a &lt;unk&gt;.S. immigration agent, testified in court that FBI agents had learned of the assassination plot from a member of the organization who was in a witness protection program. Greene said that members involved in the assassination plot included Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Yvonne &lt;unk&gt;, and Alma &lt;unk&gt;. The assassination plot was investigated by the FBI and the Oregon State Police. &lt;unk&gt; told law enforcement that Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; hoped Turner &lt;unk&gt;s death would prevent an Immigration and &lt;unk&gt; Service investigation which she thought could lead to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s arrest and &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Weaver stated &lt;unk&gt; These attempts to assassinate public officials were because they were presenting an immigration case that might result in imprisonment &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; There were not simply plans, but at least one ( assassination &lt;unk&gt; attempt, &lt;unk&gt; said Weaver at the hearing. A grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of &lt;unk&gt; widespread immigration fraud &lt;unk&gt; against members of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; crimes were discovered after Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; had fled the commune in September &lt;unk&gt;. In December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; followers of &lt;unk&gt; were indicted on &lt;unk&gt; charges. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and convictions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chief criminal assistant &lt;unk&gt;.S. attorney Baron C. &lt;unk&gt; was assigned to &lt;unk&gt; the charges of federal &lt;unk&gt;, and a special team from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Department of &lt;unk&gt;ustice Criminal Division was tasked with &lt;unk&gt; the murder conspiracy charges. Four of the &lt;unk&gt; were arrested in September &lt;unk&gt;. Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; were arrested in West Germany, Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy was arrested in South Africa, and Susan &lt;unk&gt; was arrested in England. In September &lt;unk&gt;, Alma &lt;unk&gt; pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder. &lt;unk&gt;, who had served as Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bodyguard and &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to testify against the other defendants in the murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt;nder the terms of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plea agreement she received a sentence of two years in federal prison. Carol Matthews was arrested in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Baden, Germany in October &lt;unk&gt; on charges of &lt;unk&gt; and conspiracy to murder Turner, where she was held along with three other &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of her arrest, Matthews was found in possession of a false British passport, and had been traveling under the fake name of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; were brought against Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; and six other co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conspirators by a federal grand jury in November &lt;unk&gt;. In April &lt;unk&gt;, Carol Matthews and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; from Germany to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in order to appear in federal court in Portland, Oregon. Law enforcement officials from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Service traveled to Frankfurt, Germany and took custody of the Matthews and &lt;unk&gt; at Rhine Main Airport. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Matthews and &lt;unk&gt; appeared in federal court in Oregon, and both pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy to commit murder and carrying out &lt;unk&gt;. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; pleaded guilty in federal court to participating in the murder conspiracy plot against Turner, and in exchange he received a sentence of five years in federal prison and the dismissal of other charges against him relating to firearms and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; agreed to testify against the other members of the murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; wrote on his plea agreement form : &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, meetings were held at the Rancho &lt;unk&gt;... at which time the possible killing of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Attorney for Oregon was discussed. I participated in a number of these meetings and agreed with others to work toward that object. &lt;unk&gt; Prosecutor Timothy &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; III stated that &lt;unk&gt; had been a member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune in Oregon since it began in &lt;unk&gt;, and that the government was able to prove he joined the murder conspiracy at a point in time after May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; said that &lt;unk&gt; was a member of a group called the &lt;unk&gt; Circle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was the personal security force that guarded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and that he had served as a weapons instructor and policeman at the commune. &lt;unk&gt; told &lt;unk&gt;.S. District &lt;unk&gt;udge Malcom F. Marsh that he had suggested that guns for the murder conspiracy could be bought in Texas, instructed the &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt;, took responsibility for the weapons while they were in the commune, and disposed of them when members of the murder conspiracy decided to flee the &lt;unk&gt;.S. for Europe. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, Carol Matthews entered a guilty plea and was convicted in federal court, she was sentenced to five years in prison. Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; was convicted of the attempted murder of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s physician Dr. George Meredith ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and served almost three years in jail. After her release, agents from the FBI uncovered the plot to assassinate Turner, but &lt;unk&gt; had already fled to Germany. She was indicted by a federal grand jury in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the German government refused to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; back to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.S. prosecutors filed &lt;unk&gt; in the murder conspiracy case with the Higher Regional Court in &lt;unk&gt;, Germany, as part of an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; from Germany to the &lt;unk&gt;.S. The &lt;unk&gt; stated that all of the members in the murder conspiracy plot also belonged to a group of &lt;unk&gt; followers at the Oregon commune known as &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and were trained in &lt;unk&gt; commando tactics using &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rifles and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. David Berry Knapp ( known to &lt;unk&gt; followers as &lt;unk&gt; Krishna Deva &lt;unk&gt; stated in an FBI &lt;unk&gt; that the murder conspiracy was motivated by Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; tremendous anger &lt;unk&gt; towards Turner. Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; served &lt;unk&gt; months in a minimum security federal prison for charges related to assault, attempted murder, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in &lt;unk&gt;. The assassination conspiracy was discovered after &lt;unk&gt; had left the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and as of &lt;unk&gt; she was still wanted by federal law enforcement for her role in the plot, and risked &lt;unk&gt; if she crossed the Swiss border. Switzerland declined an &lt;unk&gt; request from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and instead tried her in a Swiss court. &lt;unk&gt; was found guilty of &lt;unk&gt; criminal acts preparatory to the commission of murder &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and sentenced to time already served. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; and Susan &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; from Britain in &lt;unk&gt;, and were convicted by a jury decision on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; for their roles in the assassination plot.

During their trial the prosecution presented twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; nine witnesses, including former followers of &lt;unk&gt; who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, the former mayor of &lt;unk&gt;, testified for the government in the case and implicated &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in the assassination conspiracy.

Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; did not testify during their trial. &lt;unk&gt; We &lt;unk&gt; over everything &lt;unk&gt; evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job, &lt;unk&gt; said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the federal &lt;unk&gt;udge Malcolm Marsh described them as &lt;unk&gt; people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system. &lt;unk&gt; Prosecutor Tim &lt;unk&gt; called the conspiracy to commit assassination &lt;unk&gt; a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were released from imprisonment at &lt;unk&gt; Dublin, California in April &lt;unk&gt;, and returned to Britain.

McCarthy had served as fourth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command of &lt;unk&gt;, and was known by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s followers as Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Turner called the one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year prison sentence &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; In court statements, McCarthy stated &lt;unk&gt; I cannot forgive myself for not being &lt;unk&gt; at the time, &lt;unk&gt; and called her time with the group &lt;unk&gt; psychological torture. &lt;unk&gt; In February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; became the last perpetrator sentenced in the political assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. &lt;unk&gt; offered to turn herself in and return to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States after learning of her son &lt;unk&gt;s terminal brain tumor.

In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, &lt;unk&gt; also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years &lt;unk&gt;, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a &lt;unk&gt; sentence, and commented &lt;unk&gt; This was a lying &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, and for a long time I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed. &lt;unk&gt; Though &lt;unk&gt; could have faced life in prison, &lt;unk&gt;.S. District &lt;unk&gt;udge &lt;unk&gt;udge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had &lt;unk&gt; seen the error of her ways. &lt;unk&gt; A federal prosecutor in the case described &lt;unk&gt; as the &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, &lt;unk&gt; stated : &lt;unk&gt; I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth... No person has the right to do what I did. I &lt;unk&gt;m truly sorry. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; returned to Germany after her sentencing.

In fact, she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort, Music Box ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, when she performed six arena shows in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States during the Music Box Tour. The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews, mostly aimed at Carey &lt;unk&gt;s deemed &lt;unk&gt; obvious &lt;unk&gt; stage &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and failure to make a connection with the crowd. &lt;unk&gt; nights were more favorably reviewed, with critics raving about Carey &lt;unk&gt;s vocals. &lt;unk&gt;on Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey &lt;unk&gt;s live vocals, &lt;unk&gt; Beyond any doubt, Ms. Carey &lt;unk&gt;s voice is no studio &lt;unk&gt;. Her range extends from a rich, &lt;unk&gt; alto to dog &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns, &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; confidence, &lt;unk&gt; like a &lt;unk&gt; singer. &lt;unk&gt; However, after the strong media attention, Carey did not visit the &lt;unk&gt;S on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in &lt;unk&gt;, visiting only Europe and Asia. The tour in contrast, received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike, as well as breaking ticket sale records. Carey &lt;unk&gt;s three shows at &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s largest stadium, Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, sold out in under three hours, &lt;unk&gt; in over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets, setting the record of fastest show &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s history. On the Butterfly World Tour, Carey broke the record, selling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets in under one hour. During &lt;unk&gt;, after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly, Carey had not planned to tour once again, due to the long travel times and strain on her voice. However, due to overwhelming demand by fans, Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again, only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia, as well as one last show in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. &lt;unk&gt; for the show began shortly after Christmas &lt;unk&gt;, extending for a period of two weeks. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Concert synopsis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage, surrounded by several long draped &lt;unk&gt;. Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour, Trey Lorenz, &lt;unk&gt; Daniels and Kelly Price. As the introduction began with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, each of the &lt;unk&gt; were slowly draped, revealing Carey atop the platform, dressed in a beige mini &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dress and matching sheer &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; heels. As she began performing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song &lt;unk&gt;s performance. After an intimate performance with &lt;unk&gt; lights for &lt;unk&gt; The Roof ( Back in Time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Carey was joined on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage by a Peruvian guitar player, who played the Latin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inspired guitar melodies during her performance of &lt;unk&gt; My All &lt;unk&gt;. Afterwards, Carey sang &lt;unk&gt; Close My Eyes &lt;unk&gt;, the only sitting performance of the show. During the song, several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage. For the second part of the show, Carey had the second costume change of the evening, donning a long &lt;unk&gt; black gown and semi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hair. For the performance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Carey was joined by three female back &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up dancers, who mimicked her light dance routines during the song. The next song on the set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; list was &lt;unk&gt; Hero &lt;unk&gt;, which featured Carey alone on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage, without any vocal back &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up. After the song &lt;unk&gt;s performance, Carey was joined on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage by Lorenz, who performed &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ll Be There &lt;unk&gt; alongside her. Next came &lt;unk&gt; Make It &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey. She &lt;unk&gt; a short mini &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; skirt, alongside a &lt;unk&gt; white &lt;unk&gt; and loose golden &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage, Carey was joined by a full church choir, all dressed in long black garments. After the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, Carey performed &lt;unk&gt; One Sweet Day &lt;unk&gt;, alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in &lt;unk&gt;. After completing the song, Carey changed to a pair of leg &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hugging blue &lt;unk&gt; and a tank top. Her next performance was the &lt;unk&gt; Fantasy &lt;unk&gt; remix, featuring &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Dirty &lt;unk&gt; on a large projection screen behind the stage, as Carey performed light chair dance &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; routines alongside several male dancers. The performance featured the most intricate choreography Carey performed on the tour. After a low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; key performance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, or &lt;unk&gt; Whenever You Call &lt;unk&gt; in other countries, Carey was once again joined by several male dancers, as she sang &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the music video during a small &lt;unk&gt;. Carey once again changed to a beige ensemble similar to her first outfit before performing her debut single, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ision of Love &lt;unk&gt;. The final song on the tour was &lt;unk&gt; Butterfly &lt;unk&gt;, which featured large &lt;unk&gt; of butterflies and flowers projected onto the large screen behind Carey. She &lt;unk&gt; a long brown &lt;unk&gt; gown for the performance, being joined on stage once again by her trio of back &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up singers. During the shows in &lt;unk&gt;apan, Carey performed her holiday classic &lt;unk&gt; All I Want for Christmas Is You &lt;unk&gt;, alongside various male and female dancers on stage who performed light dance routines alongside Carey. During the song, Carey &lt;unk&gt; a Santa suit and matching hat, while being carried on a large stage prop by the dancers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the entire tour was an instant sell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out ; the four shows at &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s largest stadium, Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, broke Carey &lt;unk&gt;s previous ticket &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sales record, selling out all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets in under one hour. Additionally, the entire Australian leg sold out within hours, leading Carey to extend the tour one more date in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The show at Hawaii &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; capacity &lt;unk&gt; Stadium sold out as well, making her one of the few acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue. Aside from its commercial success, fans and critics &lt;unk&gt; about the show &lt;unk&gt;s visuals, as well as Carey &lt;unk&gt;s vocal delivery. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and recordings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the tour, several bits and performances were filmed and later edited into a &lt;unk&gt;HS and D&lt;unk&gt;D entitled Around the World. The &lt;unk&gt;HS featured performances from Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Stadium as well as few other &lt;unk&gt; and scenes that were later compiled into the video. The film first begins with performances in Hawaii, where the song &lt;unk&gt;s recitals are cut into halves, excluding the second verses and bridge to shorten the bulk length of the video. Afterwards, Carey &lt;unk&gt;s performance of &lt;unk&gt; My All &lt;unk&gt; is shown in inter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; cut scenes from &lt;unk&gt;apan and &lt;unk&gt;. After the conclusion of the song, scenes of Carey conversing with Brenda K. Starr are shown, which eventually lead to a tribute to her at a small and intimate New York club, where Carey performs &lt;unk&gt; I Still Believe &lt;unk&gt;. Soon after, Carey &lt;unk&gt;s performance in &lt;unk&gt;apan with Lorenz for &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ll Be There &lt;unk&gt; is shown, leading to scenes of Carey swimming with &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; the next title on the video is Carey &lt;unk&gt;s live rendition of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; To You &lt;unk&gt;, where she is joined by Olivia Newton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn on stage in Melbourne. A scene of a fans gathering outside of a New York City studio is shown, following a performance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Hero &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; Stadium. The &lt;unk&gt;HS was a commercial success, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA &lt;unk&gt;, denoting shipments of over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; units. The video was also certified gold in Brazil by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dos &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Set list &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Looking In &lt;unk&gt; Butterfly ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Roof &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; My All &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Close My Eyes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Daydream Interlude ( Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hero &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ll Be There &lt;unk&gt; ( with Trey Lorenz &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Make You Happy ( Trey Lorenz &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Make It &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; One Sweet Day &lt;unk&gt; ( featuring pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded Boyz II Men &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ain &lt;unk&gt;t Nobody ( Band Interlude &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Fantasy ( Bad Boy Remix &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Whenever You Call &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( featuring pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ision of Love &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Butterfly &lt;unk&gt; Without &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Butterfly ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; All I Want for Christmas is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Performed on select dates &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Personnel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Walter Afanasieff - director, keyboard Dan Shea - keyboard &lt;unk&gt;ernon Black - guitar Randy &lt;unk&gt;ackson - bass &lt;unk&gt; Conway - drums Peter Michael - percussion Gary &lt;unk&gt; - music sequencing Trey Lorenz - vocals, background vocals Kelly Price - background vocals &lt;unk&gt; Price - background vocals &lt;unk&gt; Daniels - background vocals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; - background vocals Source : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, also known as Button &lt;unk&gt;s Mill is a Grade II &lt;unk&gt; listed tower mill constructed of brick. The &lt;unk&gt; is located at &lt;unk&gt;, Suffolk, England. It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; worked by wind power until &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on two sails, after which it became &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a group of enthusiasts purchased &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site. The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt;. It drives two pairs of &lt;unk&gt;, with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; was built by &lt;unk&gt; George &lt;unk&gt; for William Button in &lt;unk&gt;. It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane, &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk the previous year. The mill was set to work on Christmas Day &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt;, Patent sails and a &lt;unk&gt;. The new &lt;unk&gt; was fitted on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. It was made by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Kings Lynn &lt;unk&gt;, and weighs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt;. A new stock was fitted in September &lt;unk&gt;. William Button died on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard. Richard Button worked the mill until &lt;unk&gt;, at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William, who sold it to Richard &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk in &lt;unk&gt;. The mill was worked by Stephen &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt;s son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in &lt;unk&gt; and leased it to Henry Bryant in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the &lt;unk&gt;. Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From &lt;unk&gt;, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of &lt;unk&gt; on the ground floor. This was replaced in &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt; oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until &lt;unk&gt; when he sold it to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;incent, a retired &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk. The &lt;unk&gt; engine was sold in the early &lt;unk&gt;s. The mill was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. &lt;unk&gt;incent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in &lt;unk&gt;. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in &lt;unk&gt; when the mill was again &lt;unk&gt;. On the death of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;incent in &lt;unk&gt;, his son George inherited the property. He lived at the site in an old &lt;unk&gt; until his death in &lt;unk&gt;. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in &lt;unk&gt; to Mr and Mrs &lt;unk&gt;, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In &lt;unk&gt;, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November &lt;unk&gt;, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark &lt;unk&gt;, Charles &lt;unk&gt;, Peter &lt;unk&gt;, David &lt;unk&gt; and Chris &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; mill and an acre of land cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Restoration &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The mill was restored over a period of six years. Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The consortium took possession of the mill in November &lt;unk&gt;. The first priority was to make the mill as &lt;unk&gt; as possible. &lt;unk&gt; sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring &lt;unk&gt;, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. &lt;unk&gt; was erected to allow the &lt;unk&gt; to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame. A two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; week work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in was held at the end of &lt;unk&gt;uly and beginning of August &lt;unk&gt;. Thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; three volunteers worked on the mill over the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine which had previously been in a &lt;unk&gt; at Bury St &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron curb sections. New oak &lt;unk&gt; were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was &lt;unk&gt;. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak &lt;unk&gt; were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the &lt;unk&gt; were made from pitch pine from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which, following its collapse on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;, had been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new &lt;unk&gt; were made for some of the windows. A &lt;unk&gt; was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The &lt;unk&gt; on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; was removed. The work was financed by grants of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; Trust, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Suffolk Mills Group. Other donations and income amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners. The &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; was reported in both local and national media, including BBC Look East, Bury Free Press, Eastern Daily Press, East Anglian Daily Times, Daily Telegraph, and Radio Orwell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt; season two separate work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held, the first from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; August and the second from &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. A total of &lt;unk&gt; volunteers participated over the two weeks. The &lt;unk&gt; were removed from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles, and over a third of the &lt;unk&gt; beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the &lt;unk&gt; frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had &lt;unk&gt; and the floor had sunk by &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed. The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was &lt;unk&gt;. The stone floor was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those &lt;unk&gt; that were fit for reuse. Other &lt;unk&gt; were made new from oak or pitch pine. New &lt;unk&gt; were laid in the dust floor, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick &lt;unk&gt; boards being double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a &lt;unk&gt; attached to the upright shaft. During the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the remainder of the stone floor was boarded, again using double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete &lt;unk&gt; cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The &lt;unk&gt;, the curb segments and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were given two coats of red lead paint. A new &lt;unk&gt; for the cap was made from a piece of oak &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; long by &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; mortar. After the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in had finished, the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; received were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Historic Buildings Council and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins took place from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower, installation of the &lt;unk&gt; curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn &lt;unk&gt;. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the &lt;unk&gt; into position. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Work in the early part of &lt;unk&gt; was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various &lt;unk&gt; and overhaul of the various parts of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails. The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits, including one from the Wind and &lt;unk&gt; Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; stones, including &lt;unk&gt; the stone nut and replacement of three &lt;unk&gt; in beech. When the weather improved, work commenced outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in commenced. The work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins took place over two separate weeks in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August, with &lt;unk&gt; people participating. During the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the &lt;unk&gt; posts and &lt;unk&gt; were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated &lt;unk&gt; were fitted and the &lt;unk&gt; was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of oak were fitted and the &lt;unk&gt; was pulled into position using a &lt;unk&gt;. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and &lt;unk&gt;. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time. Between the two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins, the rear &lt;unk&gt; was completed and the fitting of &lt;unk&gt; to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. The boards for the cap are &lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; wide at the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the &lt;unk&gt;, not without difficulty and much &lt;unk&gt; before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The &lt;unk&gt; was drawn into position using a rope and &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; steel reinforcing band &lt;unk&gt; into position, producing a &lt;unk&gt; structure. The striking rod was fitted through the &lt;unk&gt; and the axle for the &lt;unk&gt; fitted in position on top of the &lt;unk&gt; posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates &lt;unk&gt; into position. &lt;unk&gt; of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. After the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins had ended, work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application of a modern &lt;unk&gt; paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain &lt;unk&gt;, was completed in time for the lift &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on. A mini work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with &lt;unk&gt; people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The &lt;unk&gt; was removed and the &lt;unk&gt; dismantled. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, watched by a crowd of some &lt;unk&gt; people. The fitting of the cap was &lt;unk&gt; with beer from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Restoration work in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Norton Women &lt;unk&gt;s Institute, Ipswich Historical Transport Society, the National Association for &lt;unk&gt; Children, Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Four work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held during &lt;unk&gt;. The first two were by &lt;unk&gt; from Eastern Electricity Board. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person &lt;unk&gt;s Development Project for that year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A &lt;unk&gt; electricity supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were &lt;unk&gt; a thrust &lt;unk&gt; which had been developed at their research facility at &lt;unk&gt; Heath. The thrust &lt;unk&gt; laid &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; through which the &lt;unk&gt; cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and &lt;unk&gt; on each floor. Other work undertaken by the &lt;unk&gt; involved repairing some &lt;unk&gt; damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising &lt;unk&gt;. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A &lt;unk&gt; horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; diesel engine had been purchased in &lt;unk&gt; and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; site, the new brake wheel and &lt;unk&gt; were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in &lt;unk&gt;. The original brake wheel was &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their &lt;unk&gt; speed. When the mill was modernised in &lt;unk&gt; it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original &lt;unk&gt;, resulting in a wheel &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in diameter. The opinion of professional &lt;unk&gt; was sought, and it was decided that a scaled &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; was made. Some of the small &lt;unk&gt; were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the &lt;unk&gt; from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in began. New beech &lt;unk&gt; were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins held in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August, a total of &lt;unk&gt; people attending over the two weeks. A second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand stock had been bought in the &lt;unk&gt;s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and &lt;unk&gt; grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or &lt;unk&gt; stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not &lt;unk&gt; in the lengths required. Douglas fir was &lt;unk&gt; in such lengths but was discounted on strength and &lt;unk&gt; grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had &lt;unk&gt; after only seven years. Thus it was decided that &lt;unk&gt; stocks would be made. The &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with &lt;unk&gt; and well &lt;unk&gt;. It was estimated that a &lt;unk&gt; stock would be up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and nine &lt;unk&gt; were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first &lt;unk&gt; stocks made by amateurs. The four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long &lt;unk&gt; were cut from a &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine obtained from a demolished &lt;unk&gt; at Bury St &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; are &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; square at their inner end. &lt;unk&gt; bars and &lt;unk&gt; were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The &lt;unk&gt; for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and that at the tip being &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, decreasing by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in. The &lt;unk&gt; and associated &lt;unk&gt; was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; itself, with the &lt;unk&gt; painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The &lt;unk&gt; arm brake wheel was assembled around the &lt;unk&gt;. It was found that the &lt;unk&gt; was eccentric on the upright shaft by &lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. When this was corrected the brake wheel was within &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of an inch ( less than &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of true. The &lt;unk&gt; for the stocks were &lt;unk&gt; from a &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting &lt;unk&gt; and further &lt;unk&gt; on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the &lt;unk&gt; and when &lt;unk&gt; in position and the &lt;unk&gt; had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the &lt;unk&gt; and sorting out &lt;unk&gt; troubles with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the sails were cast. Restoration work in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Grants received were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from English Heritage, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council, Other donations amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; from open days at the mill came to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A boost to the funds was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a &lt;unk&gt; post mill buck to &lt;unk&gt;. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr &lt;unk&gt; allowed the donation to remain with the &lt;unk&gt; Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the East Anglian Daily Times, one of the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins being featured on &lt;unk&gt; Television &lt;unk&gt;s About &lt;unk&gt; programme. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; - &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Work planned for &lt;unk&gt; included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were &lt;unk&gt; and internal walls plastered. Two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held, from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. Further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Restoration team &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The restoration of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was made possible by the efforts of &lt;unk&gt; individuals and &lt;unk&gt; organisations. This was achieved by the donation of labour, plant, materials or grants of money, or by giving &lt;unk&gt; for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Terms explained in the Mill machinery article are in italics As built in &lt;unk&gt; A four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden &lt;unk&gt;, driving two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; wheel &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter. &lt;unk&gt; was by hand. As restored The four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; storey tower is built of brick, and stands &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; from ground level to the curb. The walls are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick at ground level. The mill is described from the top down. The &lt;unk&gt; cap sits on top of the tower, giving the mill an overall height of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;. It houses the cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter wooden brake wheel internally. &lt;unk&gt; the four double Patent sails span &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. They are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide and can develop &lt;unk&gt; horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt;. The eight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; keeps the mill turned into wind. The top floor of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives internal access to the cap. The cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt;, which is driven by the brake wheel is carried at the top of the upright shaft, in the centre of the mill. The bin floor is where the grain is stored before being ground into flour. The &lt;unk&gt; hoist mechanism is housed on this floor, driven from the wooden crown wheel on the floor below by belt. The stone floor is where the two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; French Burr &lt;unk&gt; are located. The stones are &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the &lt;unk&gt; hoist on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and a flour &lt;unk&gt;. The ground floor of the mill is the meal floor. It is where the &lt;unk&gt; ground flour is delivered for &lt;unk&gt; up. The wooden great spur wheel, located at the bottom of the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor. The great spur wheel has been converted from &lt;unk&gt; arm construction to &lt;unk&gt; arm construction. A third pair of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter French Burr &lt;unk&gt; is located on a &lt;unk&gt; frame, driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; William Button &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rebecca Button &lt;unk&gt;??

It is also open at other times by prior arrangement. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; is the first segment of the &lt;unk&gt;th episode of the second season, or the &lt;unk&gt;th overall episode of the American animated television series &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The episode was directed by Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, and was written by Walt &lt;unk&gt;, Paul &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Williams. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also served as storyboard directors, and Carson &lt;unk&gt;, William &lt;unk&gt;, and Erik &lt;unk&gt; worked as storyboard artists. It originally aired on &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The series follows the adventures and &lt;unk&gt; of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In this episode, &lt;unk&gt; reads a &lt;unk&gt; bad word &lt;unk&gt; off a &lt;unk&gt; behind the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but does not know what it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a &lt;unk&gt; sentence &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which is used &lt;unk&gt; when you want to talk fancy. &lt;unk&gt; The two start using it in every sentence they speak. However, when Mr. &lt;unk&gt; hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the &lt;unk&gt; bad words. Later on, &lt;unk&gt; accidentally swears again. Patrick then runs to tell Mr. &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; trying to stop him. However, when Mr. &lt;unk&gt; accidentally &lt;unk&gt; his toe, he &lt;unk&gt; all the &lt;unk&gt; bad words. The two cannot believe it and run to Mama &lt;unk&gt; to tell on him. Mama &lt;unk&gt;, who is &lt;unk&gt; by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment. The episode received positive reviews, while various members of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; crew consider the episode to be one of their favorites, mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode. However, the episode was not immune to negative reception, and was criticized by &lt;unk&gt; media group the Parents Television Council and fans, who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly &lt;unk&gt; use of &lt;unk&gt; towards children. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot summary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When &lt;unk&gt; goes around to the back of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to take out the trash, he reads some words written on a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; asks Patrick what is it and Patrick says that the word is a &lt;unk&gt; sentence &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which is used &lt;unk&gt; when you want to talk fancy. &lt;unk&gt; The next day, &lt;unk&gt; walks into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and says the word to Patrick and then over the &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; customers are &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s use of his &lt;unk&gt; word &lt;unk&gt; and leave. &lt;unk&gt; then informs Mr. &lt;unk&gt;, who then decides to tell them that they were using &lt;unk&gt;, and mentions that there are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; words they should not use. &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick vow Mr. &lt;unk&gt; that they will never use &lt;unk&gt; words again. Later, they play their favorite game, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Patrick always gets &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; always gets &lt;unk&gt;. Eventually, he loses the game and accidentally &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; word. Patrick then races to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to tell Mr. &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; trying to stop him. &lt;unk&gt; bursts through the front door and tells Mr. &lt;unk&gt; that Patrick said the &lt;unk&gt; word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. &lt;unk&gt; stops their &lt;unk&gt; explanations, and takes &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick outside and makes them paint the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as punishment. Mr. &lt;unk&gt; is about to give &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, throws the paint away and says all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; words while complaining about his foot being injured. When &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick hear all the &lt;unk&gt; words, they run to Mama &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; house to tell her that Mr. &lt;unk&gt; swears. When they all reach her house, they repeat the same &lt;unk&gt; words that Mr. &lt;unk&gt; used. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick for saying all those bad words in front of her she &lt;unk&gt; consciousness. Mama &lt;unk&gt; states that all three of them should be &lt;unk&gt; for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment for saying those words at her. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was directed by Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, and was written by Walt &lt;unk&gt;, Paul &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Williams. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also served as storyboard directors, and Carson &lt;unk&gt;, William &lt;unk&gt; and Erik &lt;unk&gt; worked as storyboard artists. Series creator Stephen &lt;unk&gt; has described the episode plot as &lt;unk&gt; a classic thing all kids go through. &lt;unk&gt; Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers &lt;unk&gt; own experiences from childhood. The episode originally aired on &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode marks the introduction of Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mother, Mama &lt;unk&gt;, who was voiced by former &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; creative producer and current executive producer Paul &lt;unk&gt;. The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode. The idea for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was inspired by creative director Derek &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s experience &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when &lt;unk&gt; I got in trouble for saying the f &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; word in front of my mother. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life. &lt;unk&gt; The end of the episode, where Mr. &lt;unk&gt; uses more &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick, was also inspired &lt;unk&gt; by the fact that my &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; mother has a sailor mouth herself. &lt;unk&gt; The scene where &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick playing a game of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, which is a parody of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, was difficult for the crew to &lt;unk&gt;, since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location. According to the series &lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; D&lt;unk&gt;D commentary, it was planned to have a scene that had &lt;unk&gt; saying &lt;unk&gt; Go &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; noise &lt;unk&gt; yourself &lt;unk&gt; followed by Patrick saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; noise &lt;unk&gt; you too! &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; game. It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was released on the D&lt;unk&gt;D compilation called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : Sea Stories on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It was also included in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The Complete &lt;unk&gt;nd Season D&lt;unk&gt;D released on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. On September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was released on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The First &lt;unk&gt; Episodes, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Erik &lt;unk&gt;, a member of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; crew, considers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; to be his favorite episode, mainly due to its random and satirical nature, saying &lt;unk&gt; Sometimes &lt;unk&gt; just catches me off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guard. &lt;unk&gt; Nancy &lt;unk&gt; of About.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Episodes. She said &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; just barely missed being in the number one slot. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; praised the episode &lt;unk&gt;s plot and called it &lt;unk&gt; genius &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; because children can relate to the forbidden &lt;unk&gt; of using curse words, and adults can laugh at the parody of T&lt;unk&gt; censorship. &lt;unk&gt; In an interview with Paul &lt;unk&gt;, one of the episode &lt;unk&gt;s writers, he told that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; is his second favorite &lt;unk&gt; episode. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Criticism and controversy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to a report titled Wolves in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, which documents the increase in potentially violent, &lt;unk&gt;, and sexual content in children &lt;unk&gt;s programming, the Parents Television Council, a &lt;unk&gt; media group, and fans believed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; episode &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was an implicit attempt to promote and &lt;unk&gt; use of &lt;unk&gt; among children. The episode originally aired during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; television season, ironically the season in which the PTC named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; among the best programs on cable television, but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from &lt;unk&gt; to prove its point that it promoted use of &lt;unk&gt; among children. In a later report, several members of the PTC listed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; as an example of how levels of &lt;unk&gt;, sexual, and violent activity has increased in children &lt;unk&gt;s television programming. &lt;unk&gt;, in response to the incident, said &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s sad and a little desperate that they &lt;unk&gt; to literally putting &lt;unk&gt; language in the mouths of our characters to make a point. Has the FCC looked at this? &lt;unk&gt; Richard &lt;unk&gt; of the New York Daily News criticized the report for &lt;unk&gt; an episode of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt;, over its intent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; implicitly.  &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is a blues song by American folk and blues musician, Lead &lt;unk&gt;. It was written in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead &lt;unk&gt; faced during a visit to Washington, DC to record for Alan &lt;unk&gt;. It rails against racism, the &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws, and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The song was recorded in December &lt;unk&gt; for the Library of Congress and re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded in &lt;unk&gt; for commercial release. It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Hans &lt;unk&gt;, and Billy Bragg. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is regarded as one of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s best original works, but it also drew controversy. There is doubt over the song &lt;unk&gt;s authorship, with some scholars &lt;unk&gt; that Lead &lt;unk&gt; was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator. &lt;unk&gt; have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party &lt;unk&gt;s political goals. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and creation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Most music historians date the writing of &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; to Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited by the &lt;unk&gt; Alan &lt;unk&gt; to record for the Library of Congress &lt;unk&gt;s folk music collection. On the first night Lead &lt;unk&gt; and his wife Martha spent in the city, they encountered racially &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, in some versions of the story described as an unnamed &lt;unk&gt; white friend &lt;unk&gt;, offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building. The next morning, Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; arguing with his &lt;unk&gt; about the presence of a black man, with the &lt;unk&gt; threatening to call the police. While in Washington, Lead &lt;unk&gt; encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the &lt;unk&gt; of the song. For instance, when Lead &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead &lt;unk&gt; was told that if he returned later without &lt;unk&gt;, he would be served. In response to one of these incidents, a friend of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, variously identified as either &lt;unk&gt; or Mary Elizabeth &lt;unk&gt; joked that Washington was a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; town. &lt;unk&gt; Though Lead &lt;unk&gt; did not know what the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meant, he was fascinated by the sound of it, and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip. The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead &lt;unk&gt; to write it. &lt;unk&gt; liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lyrics, themes and music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is a blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington, DC. It protests against both the city &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws and the racism of its white population. Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to &lt;unk&gt; spread the news all around &lt;unk&gt; about the racial issues &lt;unk&gt; the city. The song, particularly in the refrain, &lt;unk&gt; race and economics by referring to &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead &lt;unk&gt; encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip, Lead &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; turned down &lt;unk&gt; wherever he tried to get served due to his race, while the second recounts the argument between &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt; over Lead &lt;unk&gt; staying in his apartment. The third verse &lt;unk&gt; cites &lt;unk&gt; the home of the brave, the land of the Free &lt;unk&gt;, juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington, DC. The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city, leading to the song &lt;unk&gt;s end, which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district. The song &lt;unk&gt;s tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this, by &lt;unk&gt; spreading the news &lt;unk&gt; of his poor treatment in a song, the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status &lt;unk&gt; is deeply flawed and that something needs to change. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; follows a traditional twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bar blues format. It is written in &lt;unk&gt; time but &lt;unk&gt; to note that the song &lt;unk&gt; should swing at medium &lt;unk&gt;. The song was written in B &lt;unk&gt;. It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating, followed by the final two verses and a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Recordings and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lead &lt;unk&gt; first recorded &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt; in New York City, for donation to the Library of Congress. He re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded the song in April &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; Records, for release the same year as a &lt;unk&gt; rpm record. The version that was commercially released features Lead &lt;unk&gt; singing and playing the twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; string guitar without any other accompaniment. The song has been covered and &lt;unk&gt; by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans &lt;unk&gt;. Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums. In Australia, the song was reworked as &lt;unk&gt; Canberra Blues &lt;unk&gt; by The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an R &lt;unk&gt; B band. The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt; adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album &lt;unk&gt;ourney On in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Billy Bragg reworked the song as &lt;unk&gt; Bush War Blues &lt;unk&gt;. Bragg &lt;unk&gt;s cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War. In one verse, Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to &lt;unk&gt; make the world safe for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In another, he takes on the Christian right, asking where the &lt;unk&gt; are. Finally, Bragg &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;nited States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is one of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most famous songs and is remembered as his most &lt;unk&gt; heartfelt protest song &lt;unk&gt;. There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance. Robert &lt;unk&gt; claims that the song is &lt;unk&gt; peripheral &lt;unk&gt; to the wider study of the blues, while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wing political groups. Lead &lt;unk&gt; was invited to perform at Camp &lt;unk&gt;nity, the Communist Party &lt;unk&gt;SA &lt;unk&gt;s summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the &lt;unk&gt;s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. &lt;unk&gt;eff Todd &lt;unk&gt; and several other writers have suggested that Lead &lt;unk&gt; had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song. This theory stems from the idea that Lead &lt;unk&gt; did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by &lt;unk&gt;. Since the music that &lt;unk&gt; recorded was sold to &lt;unk&gt; sympathetic to Civil Rights, it has been suggested that &lt;unk&gt; helped him write a song attractive to a white audience. Lead &lt;unk&gt; admitted that the term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was unfamiliar to him, and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Madonna song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It was written and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price, and released as the second single from the album on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It later appeared on Celebration, her &lt;unk&gt; greatest hits album. An uptempo dance song, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was one of the first tracks developed for the album and had numerous remix treatments before the ultimate version of the track was finalized. One of the remixes was done by the Pet Shop Boys, featuring added lyrics by the band. The actual song features a dance groove tempo. It talks about personal &lt;unk&gt; and self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;. Some critics also commented on the song &lt;unk&gt;s disco &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; influenced beats while comparing it to Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s older dance songs. It achieved commercial success, topping the singles charts in Italy, Spain, Romania and the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, where it became Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s twelfth number one single. Elsewhere, the song was a top ten hit. However, in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, the song did not perform well due to an &lt;unk&gt; on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard &lt;unk&gt;s dance charts and became one of the decade &lt;unk&gt;s most successful dance hits. The accompanying music video, directed by Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;amie King, was a continuation from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; music video. It featured Madonna and her dancers &lt;unk&gt; around a city in a van, dancing on roller &lt;unk&gt; and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage. She performed the song on her &lt;unk&gt; Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video. An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song, which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;, along with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Future Lovers &lt;unk&gt;. It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna &lt;unk&gt; thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right. &lt;unk&gt; The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind. Madonna commented that, &lt;unk&gt; Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; So I thought, screw that. I &lt;unk&gt;m going to start from that perspective &lt;unk&gt;. She promoted the album at the dance party &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; held at Luke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s nightclub in Greenwich &lt;unk&gt;illage, invited by &lt;unk&gt;unior &lt;unk&gt; to take over the D&lt;unk&gt; booth where she mixed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Musically, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus. It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. &lt;unk&gt; in the key of C minor, Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s vocal range spans from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. It follows the chord progression of E &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; during the spoken introduction. It then changes to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the chorus, while continuing in A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve heard it all before &lt;unk&gt;. Lyrically the song has &lt;unk&gt; of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The song talks about personal &lt;unk&gt; and self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like &lt;unk&gt; Everybody &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ogue &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song &lt;unk&gt; Heart &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album &lt;unk&gt; Four. Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical response &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ennifer &lt;unk&gt; of MT&lt;unk&gt; News wrote that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the &lt;unk&gt; album &lt;unk&gt;s strongest track &lt;unk&gt; and that it is a &lt;unk&gt; Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; esque &lt;unk&gt; song. &lt;unk&gt; went on to say that it &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; evokes the sounds of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; era dance clubs that first &lt;unk&gt; her toward stardom. &lt;unk&gt; According to a review in the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; New single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; states &lt;unk&gt;ueen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; stance, and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics : &lt;unk&gt; there are more important things than hearing you speak &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Alan &lt;unk&gt; from BBC Music called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; catchy &lt;unk&gt;. Mike &lt;unk&gt; of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The &lt;unk&gt;acksons &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; Can You Feel It &lt;unk&gt;. The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of &lt;unk&gt;. In a review of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;irgin Media, it wrote that the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; features an &lt;unk&gt; infectious &lt;unk&gt; of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats &lt;unk&gt;. Keith &lt;unk&gt; from Billboard commented that, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; should keep fans hung up on Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s ability to create instant radio and club classics. &lt;unk&gt; He also called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while reviewing the album. Ben Williams of New York magazine, wrote that the song is &lt;unk&gt; propelled by a catchy bass melody &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;oan Morgan of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice, in review of Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;, wrote : &lt;unk&gt; The party continues &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt;, kick &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; curb &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Stephen M. &lt;unk&gt; of Pitchfork Media wrote, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of sound wash directly into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, setting up the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and shifting bass &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;on Pareles of The New York Times wrote that the first half of the album consists of love songs, happy and sad, and included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; into the mix. Alexis &lt;unk&gt; from The Guardian called the song as triumphant. Kitty Empire from the same newspaper said that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sees Madonna taking a lover to task over an &lt;unk&gt; dance &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pop rush. &lt;unk&gt; Alan Light from Rolling Stone called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Thomas &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; magazine commented that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and first single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; may not be as &lt;unk&gt; like Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s initial singles &lt;unk&gt; Burning &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; Physical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but they have the same &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of being designed for all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; night dancing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chart performance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; debuted at number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt; chart for the issue dated March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and reached a peak of &lt;unk&gt; the following week. The same week it reached a peak of &lt;unk&gt; on the Pop &lt;unk&gt; chart. Its low chart performance in America was attributed to limited radio airplay. A petition was signed by about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fans at &lt;unk&gt; Known as the &lt;unk&gt; End the Madonna &lt;unk&gt;.S. Radio &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; it was addressed to &lt;unk&gt; Channel Communications CEO Mark P. Mays. Message boards at Entertainment Weekly and &lt;unk&gt;H&lt;unk&gt; were filled with entries by users showing support for Madonna, as well as conspiracy theories about why she was not played on radio. The song, however, reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart for two weeks, as well as Hot Dance Airplay chart for five weeks. As of April &lt;unk&gt;, the song has sold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; digital units in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. In the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, it debuted at number one on the chart dated February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The song became Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th number one single in Britain and second consecutive single from the album to peak the British chart, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p. &lt;unk&gt; This made Madonna the female artist with most number one songs in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, while placing her in fifth place in overall &lt;unk&gt;. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; digital downloads there and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI &lt;unk&gt;. In Australia, the song debuted and peaked at four. The song peaked at number two on the Canadian Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA &lt;unk&gt; on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; for sales of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; units of paid digital downloads. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; debuted at number five in Ireland and was on the chart for &lt;unk&gt; weeks. Elsewhere in Europe, the song became a top ten hit for Madonna reaching the top ten of countries like Austria, Belgium ( Flanders and Wallonia &lt;unk&gt;, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland while reaching the top of the charts in Italy, Spain and Billboard &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Hot &lt;unk&gt; Singles. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music video &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The music video incorporated parts of the television show &lt;unk&gt; My Ride, and was shot by Madonna in London in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; while she was making plans for her then forthcoming Confessions Tour. It was directed by Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s longtime &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;amie King and featured choreography from The &lt;unk&gt; Brothers. Many of the performers featured in Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video were in that of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was shot as a continuation from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video. Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s parts in the video were shot first, followed by the shot of the &lt;unk&gt;. The shoot took place for over two days. The video starts with Madonna standing in front of neon &lt;unk&gt; screen in a purple &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in different languages. As the music starts she comes out from the gaming &lt;unk&gt; of her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video with her dancers. They board a van where Madonna and her dancers strip of their clothes into new ones. Madonna wears a white &lt;unk&gt; with a matching &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with her hair in &lt;unk&gt;s retro inspired style and pair of knee high silver platform boots. As they move around the city in the van, they pick up different men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse &lt;unk&gt; Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts &lt;unk&gt; backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller &lt;unk&gt;. The video ends with the close &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up of Madonna in the purple &lt;unk&gt; and fades into her &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was performed on the &lt;unk&gt; Confessions Tour as part of the &lt;unk&gt; themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a &lt;unk&gt;ean &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Paul &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with pants and high &lt;unk&gt; boots. As Madonna finished the performance of the song &lt;unk&gt; Isaac &lt;unk&gt;, she took off the &lt;unk&gt; and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and &lt;unk&gt; them one by one. The Pet Shop Boys music for the song &lt;unk&gt;s remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song. As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her &lt;unk&gt; her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer &lt;unk&gt;s back. The song was also used as a video backdrop during the interlude between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rock sections. The video featured images of fascists and political leaders from past and present like Adolf Hitler and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to George W. Bush and Tony Blair. Their images &lt;unk&gt; across the screen, with text and footage of war atrocities &lt;unk&gt; in between. Madonna appears on the screens wearing her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; video &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the words &lt;unk&gt; talk is cheap &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; don &lt;unk&gt;t speak &lt;unk&gt;, along with the music and Bush &lt;unk&gt;s lips &lt;unk&gt;. The performances of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the remix video was included in The Confessions Tour CD and D&lt;unk&gt;D. The Daily Mail called the performance &lt;unk&gt; energetic &lt;unk&gt;. Tom Young from BBC Music called the performance a &lt;unk&gt; delight &lt;unk&gt; but described the video as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the tour.

As &lt;unk&gt;apan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was designed and built in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. Shortly after her arrival in &lt;unk&gt;apan, she became flagship of the Standing Fleet, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s primary combat fleet. She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi saw no combat during World War I, although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; as a coastal defence ship in &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship. She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was recommissioned in late &lt;unk&gt;, after the start of the Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War, and used to transport &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops. In &lt;unk&gt;, she was converted into a repair ship and based first at &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; occupied Shanghai, China, and then Cam &lt;unk&gt; Bay, French Indochina, from late &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early &lt;unk&gt; to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May. She was sunk en route by the American submarine &lt;unk&gt;SS Salmon, although most of her crew survived. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Combat experience in the First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; convinced the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Navy of weaknesses in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;cole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships. Therefore, &lt;unk&gt;apan promulgated a ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year naval build &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up in early &lt;unk&gt;, to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations, with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; indemnity paid by China after losing the First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War. As with the earlier Fuji and &lt;unk&gt; classes, &lt;unk&gt;apan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. Asahi, the fifth &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleship to be built in Britain, was ordered from the &lt;unk&gt; Engineering &lt;unk&gt; Shipbuilding Company shipyard in &lt;unk&gt;, Scotland in the &lt;unk&gt; annual naval programme. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design and description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s design was a modified version of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class battleships of the Royal Navy, with two additional &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; guns. The ship had an overall length of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;, a beam of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;, and a normal draught of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. She displaced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; long tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; at normal load. Asahi had a complete double bottom with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compartments. Her hull was also subdivided into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compartments. She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about &lt;unk&gt; officers and enlisted men, including the admiral &lt;unk&gt;s staff. The ship was powered by two vertical triple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; expansion steam engines built by &lt;unk&gt;, Tennant, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by &lt;unk&gt; Belleville boilers at a working pressure of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bar ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The engines were rated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; indicated horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt;, using forced draught, and designed to reach a top speed of &lt;unk&gt; knots ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h ; &lt;unk&gt; mph &lt;unk&gt; although Asahi reached &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; knots ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mph &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; indicated horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt; during her sea trials on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. She carried a maximum of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; long tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; of coal which allowed her to steam for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; nautical miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; at a speed of &lt;unk&gt; knots ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h ; &lt;unk&gt; mph &lt;unk&gt;. The ship was fitted with three steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; driven &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hp &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s main battery consisted of the same four &lt;unk&gt; Ordnance Company &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; calibre twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch guns used in all of &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s preceding battleships. They were mounted in twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The &lt;unk&gt; powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse, at a fixed elevation of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Each mount could traverse a total of &lt;unk&gt; degrees. They fired &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound ( &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; projectiles at a muzzle velocity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; s ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;. The ship &lt;unk&gt;s secondary armament consisted of fourteen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; calibre &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; quick &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; firing ( &lt;unk&gt;F &lt;unk&gt; guns mounted in casemates. Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure. They fired &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound ( &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; shells at a muzzle velocity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; s ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;. Protection against torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boat attacks was provided by twenty &lt;unk&gt;F &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder &lt;unk&gt; cwt guns. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders fired &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; projectiles at a muzzle velocity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; s ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; guns consisted of eight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; millimetre ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder &lt;unk&gt; guns and four &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; millimetre &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder &lt;unk&gt; guns. The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the fighting tops. The three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder gun fired &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; projectiles at a muzzle velocity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; s ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder fired &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; shells at a muzzle velocity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; s ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;. The ship was also equipped with four submerged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. The waterline main belt of Asahi consisted of Harvey armour &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high, of which &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; was above the waterline at normal load, and had a maximum thickness of &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; for the middle &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of the ship. It was only &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch &lt;unk&gt; of armour that ran between the barbettes. The barbettes were &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick, but only &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; behind the upper armour &lt;unk&gt;. The barbette &lt;unk&gt; were protected by &lt;unk&gt; inches of armour on their face while their sides were &lt;unk&gt; inches thick and the roof was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick. &lt;unk&gt; bulkheads connecting the barbettes to the side armour were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches thick, but only &lt;unk&gt; inches thick at the lower deck level. The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also &lt;unk&gt; inches thick with the rear protected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; armour plates. The flat portion of the deck armour was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship. The conning tower was protected by &lt;unk&gt; inches of armour. Asahi, like all the other &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four &lt;unk&gt; and Stroud &lt;unk&gt; coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. The ships were also fitted with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; power &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Construction and career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asahi, meaning &lt;unk&gt; rising sun &lt;unk&gt;, a poetic name for &lt;unk&gt;apan from a stanza of &lt;unk&gt; poetry, was laid down on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Scotland, by the &lt;unk&gt; Engineering &lt;unk&gt; Shipbuilding Co. and completed by &lt;unk&gt;ohn Brown &lt;unk&gt; Company, which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed. She was launched on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; and completed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off &lt;unk&gt; following sea trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in Portsmouth, on the day of her completion, and arrived at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;apan, on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; and was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Battleship Division of the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; formed on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. At the start of the Russo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War, Asahi, commanded by Captain &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Division of the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;, when &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; led the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser &lt;unk&gt;, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. &lt;unk&gt; chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. &lt;unk&gt; his fire proved to be a poor decision as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; and six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt;apanese suffered &lt;unk&gt; killed and wounded before &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was not hit during the engagement. The ship participated in the action of &lt;unk&gt; April, when &lt;unk&gt; successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s flagship, the battleship &lt;unk&gt;. When &lt;unk&gt; spotted the five battleships of the &lt;unk&gt;st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and &lt;unk&gt; struck a minefield laid by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and &lt;unk&gt; was one of the &lt;unk&gt; killed. &lt;unk&gt; by his success, &lt;unk&gt; resumed long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships the following month. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on &lt;unk&gt; August, Asahi, now commanded by Captain &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was second in line of the column of &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships, behind &lt;unk&gt;, and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; although both ships were only lightly damaged by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shells struck the bridge of &lt;unk&gt;, killing the Russian squadron commander, &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, two of his staff officers and the ship &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The ship &lt;unk&gt;s wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel &lt;unk&gt;, eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; more than two months later, on &lt;unk&gt; October, Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty. &lt;unk&gt; damaged, she was under repair at &lt;unk&gt; Naval Arsenal from November &lt;unk&gt; to April &lt;unk&gt;. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or &lt;unk&gt; by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi again followed the battleship &lt;unk&gt; into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons. &lt;unk&gt; opened fire at the battleship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Russian flagship, at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser &lt;unk&gt; shortly afterwards. Within an hour the &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, knocked out her rear &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch gun turret, and jammed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s steering so that she fell out of formation. The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on &lt;unk&gt; during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time. &lt;unk&gt; was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s steering was later repaired, but she &lt;unk&gt; between the &lt;unk&gt;apanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged. Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in the late stages of the battle, although Fuji fired the shots that caused the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s magazines to explode and sink her. Asahi fired more twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shells, &lt;unk&gt;, than any other ship during the battle. In total, the ship was hit six times during the battle, but none of them damaged her significantly. While Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s casualties are not precisely known, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese only lost &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded to all causes during the battle. The battle was a total &lt;unk&gt;apanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the &lt;unk&gt;. Captain W. C. &lt;unk&gt;, the Royal Navy &lt;unk&gt;s official military observer under the Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese Alliance, took notes of the battle &lt;unk&gt;s progress from a deck chair on Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s exposed quarterdeck. His report confirmed the superiority of &lt;unk&gt;apanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was part of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese fleet that escorted the American Great White Fleet through &lt;unk&gt;apanese waters during its round &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; globe voyage. The ship was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi became a gunnery training ship in &lt;unk&gt;, and was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed in &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt;apanese guns replacing her original British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made guns. The same year, she was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;th Division of the &lt;unk&gt;rd Fleet. In &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the &lt;unk&gt;apanese intervention in the Russian Civil War. She escorted troop convoys to the Russian Far East and was guard ship at &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;anuary to August &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was reclassified as a first &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class coastal defence ship on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, and began &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; and her &lt;unk&gt; was completed in &lt;unk&gt;uly of that same year. Her displacement dropped to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; long tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; with the loss of her armour and guns, and her speed was limited to &lt;unk&gt; knots ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h ; &lt;unk&gt; mph &lt;unk&gt;. The navy decided to convert Asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August &lt;unk&gt;. From &lt;unk&gt; to October &lt;unk&gt;, the ship &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Belleville boilers were replaced with four &lt;unk&gt; Type &lt;unk&gt; boilers at &lt;unk&gt; Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( ex &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more &lt;unk&gt;, but three people each add brandy to the &lt;unk&gt;. Everyone becomes &lt;unk&gt; upon eating the &lt;unk&gt;, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one &lt;unk&gt; split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It states : &lt;unk&gt; Life in a country town is often tedious and &lt;unk&gt;, and were it not for the little &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The &lt;unk&gt; thought well of this established feature. They made it a &lt;unk&gt; occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an &lt;unk&gt; of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On the night before such an event neither &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, or &lt;unk&gt; Gale could get those minutes &lt;unk&gt; solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests &lt;unk&gt; comfort. At the first &lt;unk&gt; of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the &lt;unk&gt; into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; - the &lt;unk&gt; were ever looking after the need of the said &lt;unk&gt;. First &lt;unk&gt; Gale would &lt;unk&gt; to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir ; then &lt;unk&gt; Gale would &lt;unk&gt; over and give it a stir ; finally &lt;unk&gt; Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to &lt;unk&gt; Gale that the beloved &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had not received its &lt;unk&gt;. Off she speeds to a &lt;unk&gt; of whiskey in the kitchen. She &lt;unk&gt; into the &lt;unk&gt; the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then &lt;unk&gt; Gale remembers that the &lt;unk&gt; has not been flavored. He, too, &lt;unk&gt; himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred &lt;unk&gt;. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than &lt;unk&gt; Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten &lt;unk&gt;, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the right proportion &lt;unk&gt; in, too. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced &lt;unk&gt; employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O &lt;unk&gt;Neil. Film historian &lt;unk&gt;. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many &lt;unk&gt; Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late &lt;unk&gt;, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Martin &lt;unk&gt;. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, &lt;unk&gt;ohn W. Noble, Anna &lt;unk&gt;, Mrs. George Walters. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The single reel comedy, approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet long, was released on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The film likely had a wide national release, with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The film would also be shown in &lt;unk&gt;ancouver, Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre. In &lt;unk&gt;, years after the film &lt;unk&gt;s release, the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of &lt;unk&gt; of Moving Pictures. The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long, but did not find it to be a fault. The reviewer states, &lt;unk&gt; A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of &lt;unk&gt;, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this &lt;unk&gt;. What happened to the guests who &lt;unk&gt; of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;!... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. &lt;unk&gt; as well as &lt;unk&gt; were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to &lt;unk&gt; out to anyone. &lt;unk&gt; Walton of The Moving Picture News was not &lt;unk&gt; by the plot and stated, &lt;unk&gt; To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, &lt;unk&gt; This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation.... A weak point in the story is the fact that the &lt;unk&gt; is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two &lt;unk&gt; would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; ( sometimes referred to as Hen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a ruined chapel near &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Anglesey, north Wales, dating back to the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. The chapel &lt;unk&gt;s original purpose is unknown, but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court, or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population. It was used for a time until the early &lt;unk&gt;th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house, then later fell into disrepair. The walls still remain, with some traces of render on them internally, but there is no roof. It contains a &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century side chapel with a vault beneath, used as a burial chamber. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to &lt;unk&gt; buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &lt;unk&gt;, in particular because it is &lt;unk&gt; a substantially &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century structure &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; unusual &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century vaulted south chapel &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History and location &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The oldest parts of Capel &lt;unk&gt; date from the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west Wales were first built in stone following the end of &lt;unk&gt;iking raids and attempts by the &lt;unk&gt; to gain control of the island. The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint &lt;unk&gt;ones, author of a &lt;unk&gt; guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, authors of a &lt;unk&gt; guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as &lt;unk&gt; Hen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; hen &lt;unk&gt; being the Welsh word for &lt;unk&gt; old &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meaning &lt;unk&gt; chapel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The walls were partially rebuilt in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the vault was used to record some &lt;unk&gt; atmospheres &lt;unk&gt; for the album &lt;unk&gt; You Have &lt;unk&gt;ust Been &lt;unk&gt; By The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by The &lt;unk&gt;, a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the &lt;unk&gt;, Super &lt;unk&gt; Animals and &lt;unk&gt; that was described by one journalist as &lt;unk&gt; possibly the &lt;unk&gt; pop group of all time &lt;unk&gt;. For a time, Capel &lt;unk&gt; was used as a private place of worship for &lt;unk&gt; House, a &lt;unk&gt; venerable mansion &lt;unk&gt; once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;st Baron Boston, in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. After the early part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, however, the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair. The walls remain to gable level, with some traces of render on the inside, but the roof has gone. Capel &lt;unk&gt; is in the Anglesey countryside near &lt;unk&gt; ; the parish church of St &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; is about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away. Part of the churchyard wall remains, showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure, as often found with early churches. It is cared for by Cadw, the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales, and is open to the public. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Architecture and fittings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; is built from rubble masonry ; at about &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; up the walls, the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks, showing where the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century rebuilding started. The doorway is on the south side, headed by a plain arch, and dates from the &lt;unk&gt;th century. There is a stone bellcote at the west end. There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat &lt;unk&gt; and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located &lt;unk&gt;. There are no window openings on the north side, but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide &lt;unk&gt; and there are the remains of a window on the south wall. There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel. The vault, which is about &lt;unk&gt; square feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel. &lt;unk&gt; slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above. A stone in the nave, about &lt;unk&gt; square feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a hole in the top, might once have been used as a churchyard cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Assessment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building &lt;unk&gt; the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating &lt;unk&gt; buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &lt;unk&gt;. It was given this status on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and has been listed because it is &lt;unk&gt; important as a substantially &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century structure, with some architectural details surviving from this early period &lt;unk&gt;, even though it is now in a &lt;unk&gt; ruinous condition &lt;unk&gt;. Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists &lt;unk&gt; also notes the &lt;unk&gt; unusual &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century vaulted south chapel &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century antiquarian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey. She said that the architecture was of &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; kind, &lt;unk&gt; which &lt;unk&gt; bears testimony to its great antiquity. &lt;unk&gt; She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins, and when it was dug out, the vault was discovered, &lt;unk&gt; containing several human skeletons, which &lt;unk&gt; into dust, when exposed to the air &lt;unk&gt;. She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed &lt;unk&gt; a large mass of human bones, several feet in depth &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey, and calls Capel &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously &lt;unk&gt; with the spirit of a pagan past &lt;unk&gt;. It notes that &lt;unk&gt; the wheel has turned full circle and Capel &lt;unk&gt; today is just another ruined relic of a former age. &lt;unk&gt; The authors describe the chapel as a &lt;unk&gt; simple, square building &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; small and &lt;unk&gt; austere south chapel &lt;unk&gt;, adding that the stone slabs over the vault are &lt;unk&gt; almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; c. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a Chinese artist, &lt;unk&gt; and publisher. He worked in calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, and seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving, but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work. Hu lived in &lt;unk&gt; during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor &lt;unk&gt;s personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s capture and death in &lt;unk&gt;. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio, in which he practised various multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; colour printing and &lt;unk&gt; techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s work at the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio pioneered new techniques in colour &lt;unk&gt;, leading to delicate &lt;unk&gt; of colour which were not previously &lt;unk&gt; in this art form. Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt;, an artist &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; which remained in print for around &lt;unk&gt; years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Biography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu was born in &lt;unk&gt; County, Anhui Province in &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. Both his father and elder brother &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, art name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt;, and after he turned &lt;unk&gt; he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around Lu &lt;unk&gt;an and &lt;unk&gt;. It is commonly stated that &lt;unk&gt; himself was also a doctor, though the earliest sources &lt;unk&gt; to this occur only in the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. By &lt;unk&gt;, Hu had moved to &lt;unk&gt; where he lived with his wife Wu. Their home on &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, now also known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a hill located just within the northern city wall, served as a meeting &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; house for like &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minded artists. Hu named it the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property. It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business, where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, art name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and his sons &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, courtesy name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. During Hu &lt;unk&gt;s lifetime, the Ming dynasty, which had ruled China for over &lt;unk&gt; years, was overthrown and replaced by China &lt;unk&gt;s last imperial dynasty, the &lt;unk&gt;ing. Following the fall of the capital Beijing in &lt;unk&gt;, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in &lt;unk&gt; with Zhu &lt;unk&gt; on the throne as the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor. Hu, who was noted for his seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving and facility with seal script, created a seal for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a reward, but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in some of his subsequent personal seals &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Lost History of the South ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the &lt;unk&gt;ing invasion of &lt;unk&gt; Hu studied at the National &lt;unk&gt;niversity there, and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of &lt;unk&gt; to record official &lt;unk&gt; ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( &lt;unk&gt;in Ban &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Record of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as part of this work. As a result, he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; Academy, but before he could take up this appointment, Beijing had fallen to the &lt;unk&gt; rebellion. Since contemporaneous biographies ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s work was not published until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu &lt;unk&gt;s death. Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in &lt;unk&gt;, after the end of the Ming dynasty. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recorded visiting him during his later years, in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; respectively. He died in poverty at the age of &lt;unk&gt;, sometime around late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; was a noted seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, and he followed the &lt;unk&gt; school of carving founded by his contemporary He &lt;unk&gt;. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear &lt;unk&gt; structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. &lt;unk&gt; seals attempt to &lt;unk&gt; an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other &lt;unk&gt; artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s work was known outside his local area. Zhou &lt;unk&gt;, a poet who lived in &lt;unk&gt; around the same time as Hu and was a noted art &lt;unk&gt;, stated in his Biography of Seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Hu &lt;unk&gt; creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure &lt;unk&gt;, implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor, which he carved after a period of &lt;unk&gt; and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the Great &lt;unk&gt; of the Seal ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which he &lt;unk&gt; the loss of the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor &lt;unk&gt;s seal and &lt;unk&gt; Heaven &lt;unk&gt;s favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; footed couplets ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; used in the Imperial examinations, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Despite his reputation as an artist and seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Hu was primarily a publisher. His publishing house, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio, produced reference works on calligraphy, poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and &lt;unk&gt; ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics. &lt;unk&gt;nlike other publishers in the area, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels. This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio &lt;unk&gt;s location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( National Academy &lt;unk&gt;, which provided a captive market for academic texts. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind, aimed at a wealthy, literary audience. The studio &lt;unk&gt;s earliest publications were medical textbooks, the first of which, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was published in &lt;unk&gt; and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s brother &lt;unk&gt; was a medical &lt;unk&gt; and appears to have been the author of these books. During the &lt;unk&gt; the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio also produced political works &lt;unk&gt; the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of &lt;unk&gt; ( Huang Ming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a biography of loyal Ming officials, and the &lt;unk&gt; of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a list of Imperial &lt;unk&gt;. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Hu renamed the studio the Hall &lt;unk&gt; in the Past ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty, although the Ten &lt;unk&gt; imprint continued to be used. Despite Hu &lt;unk&gt;s withdrawal from society after &lt;unk&gt;, the studio continued to publish well into the &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty, for the most part &lt;unk&gt; on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu &lt;unk&gt;s carving work. The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China. At his studio, Hu &lt;unk&gt; experimented with various forms of &lt;unk&gt; printing, creating processes for producing multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; coloured prints and &lt;unk&gt; printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China &lt;unk&gt;s first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; block printing &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, &lt;unk&gt; process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy &lt;unk&gt; and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing called &lt;unk&gt; set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which had existed since the Yuan period some &lt;unk&gt; years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for &lt;unk&gt; some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; of shades which were not previously possible. In some images, Hu employed a blind &lt;unk&gt; technique ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designs &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; blocks &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, using an &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu &lt;unk&gt;s contemporary Wu &lt;unk&gt;, who was also a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio &lt;unk&gt; Paper ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. Both Hu and Wu used &lt;unk&gt; to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a &lt;unk&gt; income for the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major works &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt;s most notable work is the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an anthology of around &lt;unk&gt; prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic &lt;unk&gt;, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for &lt;unk&gt; to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a &lt;unk&gt; and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing methods to obtain &lt;unk&gt; of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the &lt;unk&gt; butterfly binding &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; style, whereby whole &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;niversity Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, &lt;unk&gt;. Said Charles &lt;unk&gt;, Head of the Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;niversity Chinese Department, &lt;unk&gt; The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was &lt;unk&gt;, we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it &lt;unk&gt; despite its &lt;unk&gt; importance to scholars. &lt;unk&gt; This volume went on to influence colour printing across China, where it paved the way for the later but better &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; known Manual of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Garden ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and also in &lt;unk&gt;apan, where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; e of the colour &lt;unk&gt; printing process known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; e &lt;unk&gt;. The popularity of the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty. Hu also produced the work Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio &lt;unk&gt; Paper ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a collection of paper samples, which made use of the &lt;unk&gt; stamped &lt;unk&gt; technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief. Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers, it also contained paintings of rocks, people, ritual vessels and other subjects. The book was bound in the &lt;unk&gt; wrapped back &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; style, in which the &lt;unk&gt; pages are folded, stacked, and &lt;unk&gt; along the open edges. Originally published in &lt;unk&gt;, it was reissued in four volumes between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Lu &lt;unk&gt;, and revised and republished again in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Other publications &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Other works produced by Hu &lt;unk&gt;s studio included a reprint of Zhou &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s manual of seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; script calligraphy, The Six &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the related &lt;unk&gt; Investigations into &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; Bi &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother &lt;unk&gt;, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics, entitled The &lt;unk&gt; Text of the Four Books, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the &lt;unk&gt; of the Thousand Character Classic in Six &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li &lt;unk&gt;. It was published after Li &lt;unk&gt;s death, partly in homage to him. The three Hu brothers worked together to &lt;unk&gt; a student &lt;unk&gt; on poetry by their contemporary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was called simply the &lt;unk&gt; of Poetry ( Shi Tan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Other works on poetry from the studio included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Selected Tang Poems ( &lt;unk&gt; Tang Shi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included &lt;unk&gt; by Hu &lt;unk&gt; himself. Among the studio &lt;unk&gt;s more obscure publications was a text on Chinese &lt;unk&gt; entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gallery &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a song by English musician &lt;unk&gt; Starr, released as a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; album single in March &lt;unk&gt;. Starr &lt;unk&gt;s former Beatles &lt;unk&gt; George Harrison produced the recording, which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s Concert for Bangladesh shows in August &lt;unk&gt;. The single was a follow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up to Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; hit song &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt; and continued his successful run as a solo artist. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; peaked at number &lt;unk&gt; in Britain and Canada, and number &lt;unk&gt; on America &lt;unk&gt;s Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt;. It remains Starr &lt;unk&gt;s highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; charting single in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. The title for the song was inspired by English singer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; songwriter Marc &lt;unk&gt;. Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney, reflecting Starr &lt;unk&gt;s disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; demonstrates the influence of &lt;unk&gt; rock on Starr, who directed a documentary film, Born to Boogie ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s band T. Rex around this time. Described by one author as a &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; energy in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; face rocker &lt;unk&gt;, the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus &lt;unk&gt;. Starr re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for his &lt;unk&gt; album Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses, in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as &lt;unk&gt; With a Little Help from My Friends &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Good Day Sunshine &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Baby, You &lt;unk&gt;re a Rich Man &lt;unk&gt;. The original version has appeared on Starr &lt;unk&gt;s compilation albums &lt;unk&gt; from Your Past and &lt;unk&gt; : The &lt;unk&gt;ery Best of &lt;unk&gt; Starr, and as a bonus track on his remastered &lt;unk&gt; studio album &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ienna. Since his return to touring in &lt;unk&gt;, Starr has performed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regularly in concert with the various &lt;unk&gt; of his All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Starr Band. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr identified his initial inspiration for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as having come from Marc &lt;unk&gt;, the singer and guitarist with English &lt;unk&gt; rock band T. Rex. In a &lt;unk&gt; interview with &lt;unk&gt; editor Paul Du &lt;unk&gt;, Starr described &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon &lt;unk&gt;. Over dinner one evening at Starr &lt;unk&gt;s home outside London, &lt;unk&gt; had used the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; so often that it stuck in Starr &lt;unk&gt;s mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on &lt;unk&gt;H&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, Starr explained : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was an &lt;unk&gt; guy. He used to speak : &lt;unk&gt; Back off &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; you, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Do you want some potatoes? &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; you, &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children &lt;unk&gt;s toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song. The lyrics to the middle eight of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television &lt;unk&gt;s football show, The Big Match. The program &lt;unk&gt;s host, &lt;unk&gt;immy Hill, often referred to a footballer &lt;unk&gt;s playing as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : Get yourself together now And give me something &lt;unk&gt; Everything you try to do You know it sure sounds wasted. Commentators have interpreted the song, and particularly this statement, as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles &lt;unk&gt; Paul McCartney. Starr has denied any such interpretation, instead &lt;unk&gt; claiming that the song was inspired by &lt;unk&gt; and nothing more &lt;unk&gt;, Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes. Starr had publicly criticised McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s solo albums McCartney ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Ram ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on release, and author Bruce &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the message of the middle eight as &lt;unk&gt; a plea for Paul to produce better music &lt;unk&gt;. The mention of &lt;unk&gt; sound &lt;unk&gt; ing &lt;unk&gt; wasted &lt;unk&gt; could also be a reference to McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; with cannabis, Rodriguez suggests. A further example of Starr &lt;unk&gt;s allegedly anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; McCartney message exists in the song &lt;unk&gt;s first verse : Wake up, &lt;unk&gt; Don &lt;unk&gt;t pretend that you are dead Get yourself up off the cart. The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Paul Is Dead &lt;unk&gt; hoax. The latter &lt;unk&gt; circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm, &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a &lt;unk&gt; divorce &lt;unk&gt; from the Beatles. In addition to these supposed messages in &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, observers have viewed the song title as Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March &lt;unk&gt; after a High Court judge found in McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s favour. Author Keith &lt;unk&gt; writes that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had &lt;unk&gt; long been cited as Paul &lt;unk&gt;s nickname &lt;unk&gt; from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics &lt;unk&gt; just happened to fit perfectly into the &lt;unk&gt; us vs. Paul &lt;unk&gt; mindset &lt;unk&gt; following the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; break &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up, to the extent that &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; Early &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had been &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. When &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; composition &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;m the Greatest &lt;unk&gt; for Starr to record on the album &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Lennon referenced the song title with the lines &lt;unk&gt; Now I &lt;unk&gt;m only thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; two &lt;unk&gt; And all I want to do is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although &lt;unk&gt; T Rex devotees &lt;unk&gt;, in the words of Starr biographer Alan &lt;unk&gt;, claimed that &lt;unk&gt; had ghost &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; written &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody. As on Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; hit single &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution. Starr originally offered &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to fellow &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Black to record, but she declined, hoping instead to record another new Starr &lt;unk&gt; Harrison composition, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Recording &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Having earmarked the song as his next single, Starr recorded &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;, following his appearance at the Harrison &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York. The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London, with Harrison producing, as he had on &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;. The recording reflects the influence of &lt;unk&gt; rock on Starr through what authors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Mark Easter term &lt;unk&gt; its big drum sound and &lt;unk&gt; nature &lt;unk&gt;, with a line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up comprising Starr ( vocals, drums, percussion &lt;unk&gt;, Harrison ( guitars &lt;unk&gt;, Gary Wright ( piano &lt;unk&gt; and Klaus &lt;unk&gt; ( bass, saxophone &lt;unk&gt;. Rodriguez describes Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; martial &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sounding opening &lt;unk&gt; as a rare &lt;unk&gt; showcase for his own drumming &lt;unk&gt;, while Harrison biographer Simon &lt;unk&gt; writes of &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; For the single &lt;unk&gt;s B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side, Starr had already written and recorded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the theme song for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; Western of the same name, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh. Starr produced the track with &lt;unk&gt;. The sessions for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took place at Apple on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; August, with &lt;unk&gt; guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and &lt;unk&gt;. Like the film &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the song is held in low regard by critics ; &lt;unk&gt; describes it as &lt;unk&gt; a muddy &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sounding &lt;unk&gt; with little to recommend &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Apple Records issued the single on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; in Britain, as Apple R &lt;unk&gt;, with a &lt;unk&gt;S release taking place three days later, as Apple &lt;unk&gt;. It was Starr &lt;unk&gt;s first release since &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, a year before. During this period, his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Further &lt;unk&gt; himself with Britain &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a film starring &lt;unk&gt; that included Starr &lt;unk&gt;s footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on &lt;unk&gt; March. With &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, NME critic Bob &lt;unk&gt; noted Starr &lt;unk&gt;s success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; break &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up, and wrote that the single &lt;unk&gt; confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compared with McCartney and Lennon. The song was a hit in the &lt;unk&gt;S, reaching number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt;, and achieved Starr &lt;unk&gt;s best position on the &lt;unk&gt;K Singles Chart, where it reached number &lt;unk&gt;. A promotional video for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was shot on &lt;unk&gt; March at Lennon &lt;unk&gt;s Tittenhurst Park residence while Starr was looking after the property. The video, which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like monster, was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by &lt;unk&gt; Films. A similar monster appeared on the single &lt;unk&gt;s picture sleeve, holding a cigarette. Alan &lt;unk&gt; writes of reviewers criticising &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for being &lt;unk&gt;, leading Starr to respond in a &lt;unk&gt; interview : &lt;unk&gt; Play me a pop song that isn &lt;unk&gt;t. &lt;unk&gt; On release, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : &lt;unk&gt; A Number One hit could easily be in store for the &lt;unk&gt; of rock drums. There &lt;unk&gt;s a touch of the Marc &lt;unk&gt; in this highly playable rhythmic &lt;unk&gt;... It &lt;unk&gt;s hypnotic and effective, ideal for &lt;unk&gt; and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; described the single as &lt;unk&gt; every bit as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, although &lt;unk&gt; slightly inferior &lt;unk&gt;, while Mike &lt;unk&gt; of AllMusic views it as a song where &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt; spirit of &lt;unk&gt; Starr shines through &lt;unk&gt;. In a &lt;unk&gt; article for the NME, Charles &lt;unk&gt; Murray highlighted &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; great radio and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; box tune &lt;unk&gt;. Among &lt;unk&gt; biographers, Simon &lt;unk&gt; terms it &lt;unk&gt; a rocking, soccer crowd chant that suited Starr &lt;unk&gt;s talents well &lt;unk&gt;, and Bruce &lt;unk&gt; praises the track as a &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; energy in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; face rocker propelled by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; drums and George &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; slide guitar &lt;unk&gt;. In the &lt;unk&gt; publication NME &lt;unk&gt; : Beatles &lt;unk&gt; The Solo Years &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Paul Moody listed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; first among Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; ten solo gems &lt;unk&gt; and described it as &lt;unk&gt; Good time rock &lt;unk&gt; to match the Faces &lt;unk&gt;. Guitar World editor Damian &lt;unk&gt; includes the song on his list of Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s ten best post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Beatles &lt;unk&gt; Guitar &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, saying of the recording : &lt;unk&gt; the main event is clearly Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s slightly wild, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and very &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; slide guitar solo, which includes an alternate melody line that &lt;unk&gt;s even &lt;unk&gt; than the melody &lt;unk&gt; is singing. &lt;unk&gt; Re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; releases for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; include Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; greatest hits album, &lt;unk&gt; from Your Past, and, along with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as a bonus track on the &lt;unk&gt; reissue of his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ienna album ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also appeared on his &lt;unk&gt; compilation &lt;unk&gt; : The &lt;unk&gt;ery Best of &lt;unk&gt; Starr, the collector &lt;unk&gt;s edition of which included his &lt;unk&gt; video for the song. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses version &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr recorded a new version of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for his &lt;unk&gt; album on &lt;unk&gt; Records, Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses. The song was produced by Starr &lt;unk&gt;s friend, singer Harry Nilsson, and features a musical arrangement by &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; Parks. Similar to Nilsson &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; cover of the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; You Can &lt;unk&gt;t Do That &lt;unk&gt;, the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band &lt;unk&gt;s songs &lt;unk&gt; in this case, &lt;unk&gt; With a Little Help from My Friends &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Help! &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Lady Madonna &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Good Day Sunshine &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Baby, You &lt;unk&gt;re a Rich Man &lt;unk&gt;, as well as Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;. In a further reference to his past, the &lt;unk&gt; version of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt; ten years before. Starr taped the basic track at &lt;unk&gt; Recording Studios in Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;, with additional recording taking place on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December at Nassau &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Point Studios. Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson ( vocals &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im &lt;unk&gt; ( drums &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; ( piano &lt;unk&gt;, Dennis &lt;unk&gt; and Richie &lt;unk&gt; ( guitars &lt;unk&gt;, and a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; piece horn section led by saxophonist &lt;unk&gt;erry &lt;unk&gt;. Starr &lt;unk&gt; his vocals on &lt;unk&gt; December, four days before the murder of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon, who had been due to record his contributions to Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; with his success as a solo artist in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the album continued Starr &lt;unk&gt;s run of commercial and critical failures since &lt;unk&gt; ; Rodriguez writes that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people either love or hate the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr has performed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in concert with his All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Starr Band, beginning with the band &lt;unk&gt;s debut tour of North America in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. The song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour, however, in favour of the &lt;unk&gt; Lennon &lt;unk&gt; McCartney composition &lt;unk&gt; I Wanna Be Your Man &lt;unk&gt;. Live versions of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have appeared on the multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; disc compilation The Anthology...

It runs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; from an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Garden State Parkway in &lt;unk&gt;pper Township, Cape May County to an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City, Atlantic County. The route, which is mostly a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road, passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; City, &lt;unk&gt; Manor, and Mays Landing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intersects several roads, including Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Mays Landing, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township. The portion of current Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Petersburg received funding in &lt;unk&gt; to become a spur of the Ocean Highway. In &lt;unk&gt;, what is now Route &lt;unk&gt; was designated a part of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;, a route that was to run from Cape May to &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City. Route &lt;unk&gt; was designated onto its current alignment in &lt;unk&gt;, replacing this portion of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a freeway was proposed for Route &lt;unk&gt;, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township. This proposal was canceled by the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic. The interchange between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange, with completion in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; begins at an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; section of &lt;unk&gt;pper Township, Cape May County, heading to the north on a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road. From the southern terminus, a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden State Parkway. The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings. It intersects CR &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; before coming to a junction with CR &lt;unk&gt;. Later, Route &lt;unk&gt; Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of &lt;unk&gt;. At this crossing, the road runs closely parallel to a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg, where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a &lt;unk&gt; with CR &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;pon leaving Petersburg, Route &lt;unk&gt; turns to the north again and crosses over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operations railroad line, intersecting CR &lt;unk&gt;. It continues to &lt;unk&gt; and comes to CR &lt;unk&gt;. Past this intersection, the route meets CR &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; forms a concurrency with CR &lt;unk&gt; and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt; before leaving &lt;unk&gt;. Not far after Route &lt;unk&gt;, the road crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River into &lt;unk&gt; City, Atlantic County. In &lt;unk&gt; City, it heads into residential areas, with CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the west of the route. Route &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt; continue northwest and intersect CR &lt;unk&gt;, where the road turns north into more forested areas. At the junction with CR &lt;unk&gt;, the route turns to the northeast and enters &lt;unk&gt; Manor, becoming Broad Street. CR &lt;unk&gt; splits from Route &lt;unk&gt; by heading northwest on Buena &lt;unk&gt; Road and Route &lt;unk&gt; heads through some agricultural &lt;unk&gt; concurrent with CR &lt;unk&gt; Truck, passing to the west of the &lt;unk&gt; Wildlife Area, which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds. The route intersects CR &lt;unk&gt;, turning to the northeast. After passing some homes and Stephen Lake, the road turns to the north and passes to the west of &lt;unk&gt; Manor County Park. The route crosses the South River into &lt;unk&gt; Township, passing the residential community of &lt;unk&gt; to the east and meeting CR &lt;unk&gt;. It soon enters Hamilton Township, where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Harding Highway &lt;unk&gt;. CR &lt;unk&gt; Truck heads to the west on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; at this point while Route &lt;unk&gt; heads east on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, and CR &lt;unk&gt; continues north. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; follow the Harding Highway, a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road, turning to the northeast and crossing the Great &lt;unk&gt; Harbor River. &lt;unk&gt;pon passing over the river, enters Mays Landing and turns north, encountering CR &lt;unk&gt; before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing. Here, the road crosses CR &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; splits from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by turning east along that road. Meanwhile, Route &lt;unk&gt; continues north on Cape May Avenue, passing through developed areas. It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests. The route turns to the northeast, passing near the &lt;unk&gt; Leaf Lakes residential development, before coming to an interchange with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Black Horse Pike &lt;unk&gt;. Past this interchange, Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway. The route becomes a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas, crossing into Galloway Township, where there is an intersection with CR &lt;unk&gt;. A short distance later, the road crosses New &lt;unk&gt;ersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City Station and enters &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City, turning into Philadelphia Avenue. A block after the railroad crossing, Route &lt;unk&gt; ends at an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt; ( White Horse Pike &lt;unk&gt;, with CR &lt;unk&gt; continuing north on Philadelphia Avenue at this point. Route &lt;unk&gt; is an important route linking the Atlantic City Expressway with the &lt;unk&gt;ersey Shore resorts in Cape May County, serving as an alternate to more &lt;unk&gt; routes. It also serves as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the event of a hurricane. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The portion of current Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Petersburg received funding to become a spur of the Ocean Highway in &lt;unk&gt;. The modern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; was legislated as part of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, a route that was to run from Cape May to &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City. In the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering, the portion of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City was designated as Route &lt;unk&gt;, the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering. Route &lt;unk&gt; retained its current routing in the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering. A freeway was proposed for Route &lt;unk&gt; around &lt;unk&gt;, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township. This proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the &lt;unk&gt;ersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware &lt;unk&gt;alley. However, this freeway was canceled by the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route &lt;unk&gt;. On November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, construction began on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the Atlantic City Expressway. This project was completed on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native football team &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. It mostly comprised players of M&lt;unk&gt;ori ancestry, and also included some &lt;unk&gt; ( white New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt;. A wholly private &lt;unk&gt;, the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player &lt;unk&gt;oseph &lt;unk&gt;, promoted by civil servant Thomas &lt;unk&gt;, and managed by &lt;unk&gt;ames Scott, a &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; were the first New Zealand team to perform a &lt;unk&gt;, and also the first to wear all black. They played &lt;unk&gt; rugby matches during the tour, as well as a small number of &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia. Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby, the &lt;unk&gt; were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in &lt;unk&gt;. After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt;, the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez. The M&lt;unk&gt;ori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race, but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori &lt;unk&gt; as they had expected. Playing their first match, on &lt;unk&gt; October against Surrey, the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule, and frequently played three matches per week. Their early matches included a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Middlesex, but their form improved in November, when they won &lt;unk&gt; of their &lt;unk&gt; matches. The team played its first international match on &lt;unk&gt; December, against Ireland, and won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams, Yorkshire, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat against the Wales national team. By &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; had played &lt;unk&gt; matches in less than three months, winning &lt;unk&gt; of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England, where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable. In a return match on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; heaviest losses, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat. The team then went undefeated until &lt;unk&gt; February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( RF&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international, during which the RF&lt;unk&gt; secretary George Rowland Hill, &lt;unk&gt; the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the &lt;unk&gt; to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official send &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off, and travelled to Australia where they toured &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. They then returned to New Zealand, where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before. They went &lt;unk&gt; games undefeated before losing their final match, on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Auckland. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; final record in rugby matches was &lt;unk&gt; wins, &lt;unk&gt; draws and &lt;unk&gt; losses. They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home, and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion in &lt;unk&gt;. Seventeen of the team &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; players went on to play &lt;unk&gt; in New Zealand, and two, Thomas &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The idea for assembling a team of M&lt;unk&gt;ori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by &lt;unk&gt;oseph &lt;unk&gt;, a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in &lt;unk&gt;. He initially proposed a team of M&lt;unk&gt;ori or part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori to play the touring British side in &lt;unk&gt; ; this developed into a venture to have a M&lt;unk&gt;ori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful. &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plans, civil servant Thomas &lt;unk&gt; contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which &lt;unk&gt; accepted. When &lt;unk&gt;ames Scott, a &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that &lt;unk&gt; would be the team &lt;unk&gt;s captain, Scott its manager and &lt;unk&gt; its promoter. &lt;unk&gt; started assembling a team for the tour in early &lt;unk&gt;. He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability, and failed to secure the talented &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; due to his university commitments. Some M&lt;unk&gt;ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori. Twenty M&lt;unk&gt;ori or part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori players joined the squad ; five &lt;unk&gt; ( white New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these &lt;unk&gt; players the team was renamed from the &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native Football Representatives &lt;unk&gt;. The final squad comprised &lt;unk&gt; players ( including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; of these at least five were full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori, while fourteen had a M&lt;unk&gt;ori mother and a &lt;unk&gt; father. The parentage of some of the players is unknown. The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas, playing against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay, Auckland, Nelson, Wellington, Canterbury, South Canterbury, and &lt;unk&gt;. The first game was contested against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay in Napier on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand, and won seven of them. Their last New Zealand match before departure, against &lt;unk&gt; played in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, was won by one try to nil. The team sailed for Australia from &lt;unk&gt;, leaving on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. In Melbourne, Scott recruited &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; to train the players in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches on their return to Australia. The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion team, winning the first and drawing the second, before continuing to Britain via Suez. They arrived in London on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in England and early matches &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators, including an official of England &lt;unk&gt;s Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( RF&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first match of the tour was against Surrey, where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a &lt;unk&gt;, and also the first to wear an all black uniform. That the team was predominantly M&lt;unk&gt;ori provoked curiosity from the British press &lt;unk&gt; at the time, most Britons had not seen non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white people &lt;unk&gt; but there was some surprise that the team were not as &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori &lt;unk&gt; as had been expected. &lt;unk&gt; They are not unlike Europeans, &lt;unk&gt; a Scottish reporter wrote in November &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation &lt;unk&gt;. The Surrey match, which was &lt;unk&gt; by the RF&lt;unk&gt; secretary George Rowland Hill, was won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt; after they scored two tries. The &lt;unk&gt; next defeated both &lt;unk&gt; and Kent, before defeats by &lt;unk&gt; and Burton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Trent. Both defeats were unexpected, and in the &lt;unk&gt; match, injuries played a part &lt;unk&gt; the tourists played most of the match at least two men down, as replacements were then not allowed. The team recovered to win their next game, against Midlands Counties in Birmingham. Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public, and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park, &lt;unk&gt;. The Middlesex side contained a number of international players, including Arthur Gould. Middlesex won easily, with the &lt;unk&gt; play characterised by poor tackling. The final score was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders. Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine &lt;unk&gt; an indulgence the &lt;unk&gt; were not used to. A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition &lt;unk&gt; of scratch players, whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully collected the best possible team available. Such &lt;unk&gt; passing &lt;unk&gt; as the Home men displayed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; admit they have never previously witnessed. Said &lt;unk&gt; whilst we were on the platform waiting for the London train, &lt;unk&gt; I think they would have just beaten us, even if we had been in good form. &lt;unk&gt; Following the match against Middlesex, the team travelled to the north, where the strongest English rugby teams were based. Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RF&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; over the issue of &lt;unk&gt; broken time &lt;unk&gt; payments. The New Zealanders lost to Hull &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, defeated &lt;unk&gt;, then lost to Wakefield. After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County &lt;unk&gt; they defeated Stockton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt; appeared in the match against &lt;unk&gt;, but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point. These victories were followed by a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat to Halifax on &lt;unk&gt; November. The team then won seven matches in a row, including one against &lt;unk&gt; RFC, their only Scottish opposition of the tour. The last two matches that month were a loss to &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory over Liverpool and District. The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them. By this point, the team was beset by injuries &lt;unk&gt; of the fifteen players that played against &lt;unk&gt; County on &lt;unk&gt; November, five had injuries. The squad comprised only &lt;unk&gt; players, and the tourists were often struggling to field a side. Nevertheless, their heavy schedule continued ; on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; they left for Dublin, where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ireland, further English matches, and Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. Both teams had a number of leading players out injured &lt;unk&gt; the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection. Ireland led &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time after scoring a converted try, but the &lt;unk&gt; improved considerably in the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half, scoring four tries. Patrick &lt;unk&gt; scored the first two tries, and his play was praised by the local press. The third try scored was by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; after a counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack by George Williams. The try was not converted, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the &lt;unk&gt; Home Nations Championship. Following their defeat of Ireland, the &lt;unk&gt; played Trinity College and then North of Ireland. The match against Trinity College was drawn &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and despite &lt;unk&gt; not playing, the Native side played much better than their previous fixture. The team then travelled to Belfast, where they defeated North of Ireland &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; December ; scoring two tries to nil. After returning to England, the &lt;unk&gt; faced Lancashire in Manchester, where they lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Two days later they drew with &lt;unk&gt; Bulldogs, despite their opposition scoring five tries. Their next match was against Yorkshire, who were one of the strongest counties in the country, and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season. Yorkshire fielded a weakened team, and were subsequently defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;, who scored six tries. After a further two victories, the team travelled to Wales, where they lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, before facing Wales on &lt;unk&gt; December. At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and &lt;unk&gt; feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players. Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time, and out of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; had been selected. The match was played in Swansea, and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd, with gate receipts of only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recorded. The crowd &lt;unk&gt;s hostility impacted on the players, and &lt;unk&gt; Norman &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; nervous &lt;unk&gt; at the start of the match. &lt;unk&gt;, aged &lt;unk&gt; years and &lt;unk&gt; days, became the youngest Welsh international player &lt;unk&gt; a record he held until the debut of Tom &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Despite the &lt;unk&gt; aimed primarily at &lt;unk&gt;, Charlie Arthur and George Thomas, the Welsh team produced an excellent effort, especially from the forwards. Towers scored the first Welsh try, which was converted by &lt;unk&gt;im Webb. The &lt;unk&gt; replied with a spirited run by &lt;unk&gt;, but he failed to break through the Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a &lt;unk&gt; try &lt;unk&gt; the half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way line, which went some way to silence the &lt;unk&gt; from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The &lt;unk&gt; continued to push, with Elliot coming within five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yards of the try line, and when &lt;unk&gt; did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the ball into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing &lt;unk&gt;im &lt;unk&gt; to score. &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game. The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed. In the &lt;unk&gt; Home Nations Championship Wales had &lt;unk&gt; the four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again tried the four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter system against the &lt;unk&gt;, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter style of play. Before they left Wales, the &lt;unk&gt; played Swansea and two other local clubs, Newport, and Cardiff. They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales, and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spectators. They finished their Welsh matches, and the year, with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to England &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The side entered &lt;unk&gt; having played &lt;unk&gt; matches for &lt;unk&gt; wins and three draws. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement. The team would go on to play a further &lt;unk&gt; matches before their &lt;unk&gt; February international against England. &lt;unk&gt;anuary started with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Bradford, during which &lt;unk&gt; police officers were required to keep many of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spectators, many of them non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; paying, in order. This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Rangers, and Huddersfield. Following further matches against &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, where the team drew, lost, then won, the side faced Yorkshire for a second time. Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up against the &lt;unk&gt; when the sides first met in December. After the unexpected loss, Yorkshire were determined to make &lt;unk&gt; and a strong side was selected for the county, including Fred &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Willie &lt;unk&gt;, all of whom would appear for England against the &lt;unk&gt; later that season. Described as &lt;unk&gt; knocked about &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; stale &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; struggled to compete against such strong opposition, and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to &lt;unk&gt; left the scores at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time. The second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half was little better for the &lt;unk&gt; ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal. The second of these tries was scored by &lt;unk&gt; after he ran the ball from his own half. &lt;unk&gt; scored a converted try late in the match, but this didn &lt;unk&gt;t prevent the &lt;unk&gt; suffering their largest defeat of the tour : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; later described the match as &lt;unk&gt; without a &lt;unk&gt;, the biggest beating we received in our whole tour &lt;unk&gt;. After a victory over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;alley District, the team travelled west to play &lt;unk&gt;, Devonshire, Taunton, and Gloucestershire, and won all five games. The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt; largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. Half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back &lt;unk&gt; played outstandingly for the &lt;unk&gt;, while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition. Devonshire and &lt;unk&gt; suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed. After defeating Midland Counties, the &lt;unk&gt; returned to London. The team had two further matches before their international against England. The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England, &lt;unk&gt;. Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the &lt;unk&gt; British Isles side, played for the club in their &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat to the &lt;unk&gt;. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by &lt;unk&gt;. Their next opposition was a &lt;unk&gt;nited Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The &lt;unk&gt; were again victorious, this time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The match against Oxford &lt;unk&gt;niversity was postponed due to heavy &lt;unk&gt;, and so the team had a seven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day break from playing &lt;unk&gt; their longest of the tour. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; England international &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The match against England was causing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; players and management problems before it had even begun. The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RF&lt;unk&gt; over where the match should be played &lt;unk&gt; the RF&lt;unk&gt; were adamant that the match should take place at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RF&lt;unk&gt; establishment were already suspicious of the profit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; making motives of the &lt;unk&gt;, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RF&lt;unk&gt; was also in dispute with the other Home &lt;unk&gt; over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Following a disputed try in an England &lt;unk&gt; Scotland international match in &lt;unk&gt;, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RF&lt;unk&gt; insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until &lt;unk&gt;, when, following arbitration, the RF&lt;unk&gt; relented and joined the &lt;unk&gt;. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ups selected for the &lt;unk&gt; February match were both strong, and close to full strength. Though &lt;unk&gt; of the England side had not played internationally before, all were experienced at domestic level. The match was &lt;unk&gt; by Rowland Hill, who had also &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; first match in Britain, against Surrey. The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair, with much tackling and &lt;unk&gt; on the heavy ground. Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford, but both were disputed by the &lt;unk&gt;, who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal. England took the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; try advantage into the second half. Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English. The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the &lt;unk&gt; and the RF&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to tackle the English player &lt;unk&gt;, and in the process ripped his shorts off. The &lt;unk&gt; quickly formed a circle around &lt;unk&gt; to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank &lt;unk&gt;, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming &lt;unk&gt; had called &lt;unk&gt; dead ball &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but Hill awarded the try, prompting three of the Native players, Dick &lt;unk&gt;, Williams, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to leave the field in protest. The &lt;unk&gt; players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had &lt;unk&gt; play. &lt;unk&gt; was very critical of Hill, particularly because he was also Secretary of the RF&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; wrote after the tour that &lt;unk&gt; gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; at all in that game &lt;unk&gt;. The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English, who ultimately won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The RF&lt;unk&gt;, at Hill &lt;unk&gt;s instigation, promptly demanded an apology from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; captain of the day, Edward &lt;unk&gt;, who had led the team as &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt; was injured. The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RF&lt;unk&gt; threatened to bar any of their affiliated players &lt;unk&gt; in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England &lt;unk&gt; from facing the &lt;unk&gt; if they did not &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another, four days after the game : The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt; approach to the game ; reports of rough and over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; aggressive play by the &lt;unk&gt; had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt;, accused the RF&lt;unk&gt; and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to &lt;unk&gt; the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later matches and departure from England &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on &lt;unk&gt; February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford &lt;unk&gt;niversity. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over &lt;unk&gt;, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground &lt;unk&gt; said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; win, the &lt;unk&gt; suffered a loss to Barrow and District on &lt;unk&gt; March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; draw with Hull. &lt;unk&gt; were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists &lt;unk&gt; last match in northern England. The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This was their &lt;unk&gt; match in the British Isles and their &lt;unk&gt;th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the &lt;unk&gt; boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived &lt;unk&gt; from the RF&lt;unk&gt; provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team &lt;unk&gt;s official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The majority of the &lt;unk&gt; left Plymouth on &lt;unk&gt; March ( &lt;unk&gt; and Pie &lt;unk&gt; followed a week later &lt;unk&gt;. They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; to coach them in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the &lt;unk&gt; were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules &lt;unk&gt;, ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition. The side &lt;unk&gt;s success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules &lt;unk&gt; the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in &lt;unk&gt;ictoria : against Melbourne, a Navy selection, and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria. The matches were all won, with their game against &lt;unk&gt;ictoria a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches, and defeated New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After two further victories, the side again faced New South Wales, and won the match &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Another two victories followed, before the team played their only association football matches of the tour &lt;unk&gt; both defeats. The team travelled north to &lt;unk&gt;ueensland, where, as in New South Wales, rugby was the dominant code of football. Consequently, the team exclusively played rugby while in the region. The &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt;ueensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane. The &lt;unk&gt; spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the &lt;unk&gt; to win &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the &lt;unk&gt; did not exert themselves in the win, and the score did not reflect their dominance. After a further two matches, against &lt;unk&gt; and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated &lt;unk&gt;, the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. In contrast to their first meeting, the first &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half was a close affair, and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half. Billy &lt;unk&gt; suffered a kick to the head, and had to retire early in the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half. Following the loss of &lt;unk&gt;, the play of the &lt;unk&gt; improved and they recovered to win &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; to throw the game. &lt;unk&gt; later said : It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought, in racing &lt;unk&gt;, to be playing &lt;unk&gt; stiff &lt;unk&gt;, and that they had been got by some &lt;unk&gt; ; at all events, when accused of it at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time and cautioned, they played a different game in the second half. The response from the team &lt;unk&gt;s management was to suspend four players. The team travelled to &lt;unk&gt;, where they defeated the locals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; included a replacement player for only the second time, Charles &lt;unk&gt;, after the &lt;unk&gt; reduced the playing strength of the side. The team then travelled back to New Zealand, and arrived in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Two days after their return, the &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt;, who they defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in front of a crowd of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The side suffered further injury, to Harry Lee, and recruited &lt;unk&gt; W. &lt;unk&gt; for their match against &lt;unk&gt; District on &lt;unk&gt; August. Despite playing the match two players down, the &lt;unk&gt; comfortably defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Following the side &lt;unk&gt;s return to New Zealand, the &lt;unk&gt; Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion demanded that the team &lt;unk&gt;s management explain the accusations levelled at them in &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. &lt;unk&gt; responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted, and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred. The Northern Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion ( since renamed &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt; summarised the incident and aftermath in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion Annual :... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the &lt;unk&gt;, as they were not showing their usual dash and combination. Four members of the team were suspended, a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match. The matter was bought before the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;nion, who passed the following resolution : That, having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team, and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management, we are of opinion that there are no facts before us &lt;unk&gt; the allegations... It is unlikely, given the attitude of the &lt;unk&gt; Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion to the &lt;unk&gt; before their departure, that they would have dismissed the allegations if &lt;unk&gt; evidence had existed. The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; their opponents five tries to two, and won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The side &lt;unk&gt;s star player and half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back, &lt;unk&gt;, stayed in &lt;unk&gt; when the team departed for &lt;unk&gt;. The side faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay, who were touring, in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; defeated them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; play was praised by The Press : &lt;unk&gt;... the &lt;unk&gt; of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and &lt;unk&gt; between their legs, over their shoulders, under their arms and with their feet &lt;unk&gt;. The side then faced Canterbury on &lt;unk&gt; August, who they &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The report published in The Press said of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performance : The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men. In the loose, in the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, passing, &lt;unk&gt;, or running they were very much indeed Canterbury &lt;unk&gt;s superior. Such runs as were made by &lt;unk&gt; at full back, by Madigan, &lt;unk&gt;, and W. &lt;unk&gt;, the passing of H. &lt;unk&gt;, F. &lt;unk&gt;, and all the backs as well as several forwards, the rushes of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Maynard, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; powers of nearly every one, &lt;unk&gt; their opponents... The side left &lt;unk&gt; and travelled north where they played &lt;unk&gt; in Masterton. The match was won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the next day they faced Wellington, who they also defeated. The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the &lt;unk&gt; all profit from the match. After this the &lt;unk&gt; travelled to Auckland where they played their last match, against the province on &lt;unk&gt; August. The match was lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after each team scored two tries each, but the &lt;unk&gt; kicked a drop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal and a conversion. The loss ended a remarkable run of matches &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; had a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March ; the side won &lt;unk&gt;, and drew one match between the defeats. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Impact and legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand. It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere, and the longest in the history of the sport. By the time the &lt;unk&gt; returned to New Zealand, they had developed into a side superior to any in the country, and introduced a number of tactical innovations. Seventeen of the &lt;unk&gt; players went on to play &lt;unk&gt; in New Zealand, and two, &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently captained New Zealand. The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt;, later renamed New Zealand Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides. The &lt;unk&gt; sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team, captained by &lt;unk&gt;, to tour Australia in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; are also the &lt;unk&gt; of the M&lt;unk&gt;ori All Blacks, a representative team organised by the &lt;unk&gt;, that first played in &lt;unk&gt;. The Native team, along with &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt;, was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the seventh &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Squad &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The squad consisted of &lt;unk&gt; players.

She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik &lt;unk&gt;, Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky, including the title role in the latter &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The niece of Lady &lt;unk&gt; and Sir Wilfrid &lt;unk&gt;, who also were her patrons, she initially trained and performed in Europe. She then travelled to &lt;unk&gt;ava and for four years immersed herself in its native music, which she introduced to North American audiences on her return. She retired from performing in &lt;unk&gt;, and opened a voice studio in New York, where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors. &lt;unk&gt; was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music. The citation from the &lt;unk&gt; Society of San Francisco, which she received in &lt;unk&gt;, said : &lt;unk&gt;... her rare open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Singing career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Born in Ottawa, Ontario, &lt;unk&gt; received musical lessons as a child, in harmony, voice, and piano. The custom of the time dictated that North American musicians travel to Europe for training if they desired a &lt;unk&gt; professional career, and in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, at the age of seventeen, &lt;unk&gt; set out for Europe, financed by her aunt and uncle, Lady &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Sir Wilfrid &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training in Europe &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; travelled to France, where she received private voice lessons from Auguste &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ean &lt;unk&gt; of the Paris &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; on her vocal &lt;unk&gt; were problematic, but they were removed &lt;unk&gt;. She later began training under &lt;unk&gt;acques &lt;unk&gt;, whom she would later credit for her vocal technique. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour. Albani provided a degree of &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; week tour of Canada. Lord &lt;unk&gt; awarded &lt;unk&gt; a scholarship in &lt;unk&gt; that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies. She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. Her first operatic performance came in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Italy as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Carmen. She landed a second operatic role as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. The opera opened in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; soprano of the company, feared that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s voice would &lt;unk&gt; her own, and demanded that &lt;unk&gt; be removed from the opera. The company &lt;unk&gt;s director &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s demands, informing &lt;unk&gt; on opening night that she would not be performing. &lt;unk&gt; reacted badly, and quit opera entirely. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;ava &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, &lt;unk&gt; departed Europe and travelled to &lt;unk&gt;ava. There, she met a Dutch &lt;unk&gt; and plantation manager named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; married on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; studied the music of &lt;unk&gt;ava, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul &lt;unk&gt;, who had previously been the conductor for the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, which afforded &lt;unk&gt; a number of opportunities. On permission of the &lt;unk&gt;avanese court, she studied the &lt;unk&gt;, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in &lt;unk&gt;ava, &lt;unk&gt; travelled extensively, giving performances in China, &lt;unk&gt;apan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in &lt;unk&gt;ava for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to North America &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Arriving in New York, &lt;unk&gt; struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in &lt;unk&gt;audeville entitled &lt;unk&gt;, which combined &lt;unk&gt; music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so &lt;unk&gt; focused on her &lt;unk&gt; musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. &lt;unk&gt; began giving annual recitals at &lt;unk&gt; Hall, and in November &lt;unk&gt; her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a &lt;unk&gt;... sensitive &lt;unk&gt; of interesting, &lt;unk&gt; songs &lt;unk&gt;. She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky &lt;unk&gt;s Three &lt;unk&gt;apanese Lyrics and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five Poems of Ancient China and &lt;unk&gt;apan. The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have &lt;unk&gt; to premiere all of his vocal pieces. &lt;unk&gt; travelled to Paris in &lt;unk&gt; at the behest of the Music League of America. &lt;unk&gt; there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik &lt;unk&gt; and Les six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a refusal to perform &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by Arnold &lt;unk&gt;. Through this, &lt;unk&gt; performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. &lt;unk&gt; toured America frequently and returned to Europe in &lt;unk&gt;, and again in &lt;unk&gt;. She began to explore &lt;unk&gt;azz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics. Her &lt;unk&gt; annual performance at &lt;unk&gt; Hall entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Ancient and Modern Music for &lt;unk&gt;oice &lt;unk&gt; became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George &lt;unk&gt;, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold &lt;unk&gt;, Darius &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Paul &lt;unk&gt;. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by &lt;unk&gt;erome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George &lt;unk&gt; : I &lt;unk&gt;ll &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; to Paradise, Innocent &lt;unk&gt; Baby, and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included &lt;unk&gt; Schumann &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;irgil Thomson, and Paul &lt;unk&gt;. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include &lt;unk&gt;azz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. &lt;unk&gt; continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of &lt;unk&gt; in New York in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, as well as in London in &lt;unk&gt;, this was quite successful. A critic in &lt;unk&gt;ienna welcomed her musical selection as a &lt;unk&gt; from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, &lt;unk&gt;, Wolf, Richard &lt;unk&gt; - while praising her skill with more classical choices. Other performances suffered &lt;unk&gt; she was &lt;unk&gt; while performing works by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;illa &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in &lt;unk&gt;enice. She became a celebrity, and continued giving performances across the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, Europe, and her native Canada. On the &lt;unk&gt; anniversary of Canadian Confederation in &lt;unk&gt;, she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first &lt;unk&gt; radio broadcast in Canada. Although she toured Canada from time to time, and attended performances of Canadian music in New York, she held a negative opinion of Canada &lt;unk&gt;s treatment of native musicians, saying &lt;unk&gt; Canadians... would rather listen to foreigners than their own people. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the stage &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Illness forced &lt;unk&gt; to halt giving performances in the late &lt;unk&gt;s, but she would return to the stage in &lt;unk&gt;, giving a concert in Havana, Cuba. As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching, and less and less in stage performing. Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring. She retired from performing entirely in &lt;unk&gt;, and opened a music studio in New York. There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists, serving on its board of governors. She died on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of critics and audiences &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a controversial musician in her time. Her choice of music for performance was often condemned, and often praised. The &lt;unk&gt; of jazz music for a &lt;unk&gt; trained singer, combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to &lt;unk&gt; her for promoting otherwise overlooked music, and others to &lt;unk&gt; her for taking &lt;unk&gt; music into a &lt;unk&gt; venue. A May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; review by the New York Times praised her natural talent, with some reservations about the &lt;unk&gt; quality of her voice. Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : &lt;unk&gt;... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them. &lt;unk&gt; A November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs, as well as modern English, French, Austrian, German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music. The critic remarked &lt;unk&gt; Her voice was much too good for jazz. &lt;unk&gt; Here she was praised as a serious, scholarly artist whose performance was &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; and expressive. &lt;unk&gt; The audience received the concert very enthusiastically. Her performance in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; resulted in a headline in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the next day that was headed Eva &lt;unk&gt; ’ s Program &lt;unk&gt; Whole Town &lt;unk&gt; : Many People Are of Two &lt;unk&gt; Regarding &lt;unk&gt;azz Numbers &lt;unk&gt; Some &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; That They Like Them &lt;unk&gt; Others &lt;unk&gt; Silent or &lt;unk&gt; Them. The review divides the audience and critics into various camps : those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance ; those who openly disliked and condemned it ; those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate ; and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; materials &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; papers, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music Division, The New York Public Library.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michigan Wolverines men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michigan Wolverines men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team represented the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Michigan during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Division I men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball season. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan at &lt;unk&gt; Center for the &lt;unk&gt; consecutive year. It had a seating capacity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It was also the team &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; straight season as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year head coach &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; led the team, alongside All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten players Trey Burke, Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r. and Zack Novak. Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and was Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first Associated Press All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American &lt;unk&gt; since &lt;unk&gt;. The team &lt;unk&gt;s season began with a preseason media day and practices in October &lt;unk&gt;. In February &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan hosted ESPN &lt;unk&gt;s College &lt;unk&gt; for the first time in a game against Ohio State. It was the eighth time a Big Ten team hosted the show, which began in &lt;unk&gt;. The team was in the national rankings all season and ended as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; champion with Michigan State and Ohio State. It had three victories over teams ranked in the top &lt;unk&gt; at the time of the meeting ( eighth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Memphis, ninth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Michigan State and sixth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Ohio State &lt;unk&gt;. The team was undefeated at home until its last home game of the season. Michigan lost in the semifinals of the &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Conference Tournament and bowed out in the second round of the &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Tournament to end the season with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; record. The team won the school &lt;unk&gt;s first Big Ten Conference Championship since the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season and had the school &lt;unk&gt;s best Big Ten record ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; since the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; incoming team members &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Before the season began, point guard Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists leader in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles &lt;unk&gt;. The incoming class included Carlton &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Ohio Mr. Basketball point guard Trey Burke.

Illinois &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who along with &lt;unk&gt; was recruited by &lt;unk&gt; League schools, rounded out the incoming class. &lt;unk&gt; earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on candidate for the basketball team. Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r., son of former NBA All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Star Tim &lt;unk&gt;, returned to the team.

The team began the season in a renovated &lt;unk&gt; Arena : new seats and a high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; definition &lt;unk&gt; were added, but seating capacity was reduced to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the previous &lt;unk&gt; seasons.

Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r. was named the Big Ten Player of the Week, and Trey Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week. In an ACC &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Challenge game in late November, Michigan lost to &lt;unk&gt;irginia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In its next game, Michigan defeated Iowa State &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. On December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan beat Oakland &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, its highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scoring game since beating Northern Michigan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It was also Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first game since &lt;unk&gt; with three &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; point scorers ( &lt;unk&gt;, Burke and Evan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Burke earned his second Freshman of the Week honor on December &lt;unk&gt; after scoring a season &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points and nine assists in the game. On the same day, Michigan was the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated Big Ten team in the Ratings &lt;unk&gt; Index, although the team trailed several schools in the national polls. In the final two non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conference games of the season, &lt;unk&gt; scored his first two double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; doubles against Alabama A &lt;unk&gt; M and Bradley on December &lt;unk&gt; and December &lt;unk&gt;. Heading into the Big Ten Conference schedule, both of the teams Michigan had lost to were ranked ( Duke was &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th in the AP and Coaches &lt;unk&gt; polls and &lt;unk&gt;irginia was &lt;unk&gt;rd and &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;. On December &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan won its first Big Ten Conference opener since &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, beating Penn State as &lt;unk&gt; extended his double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; double streak to three games. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Burke earned his first Big Ten Conference Player of the Week honor and his third Freshman of the Week honor for his &lt;unk&gt; points in Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first two conference games. On December &lt;unk&gt; against Penn State he posted &lt;unk&gt; points, seven assists, five rebounds and no turnovers. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, he added a career &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shooting with three rebounds and three assists against Minnesota to earn Big Ten Conference Player of the Week the following day. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan became the leader in the conference with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; record, thanks to conference wins over ranked Wisconsin and Michigan State teams. Michigan remained in first place until losing to Ohio State ten days later. The team went &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in conference in February, including wins over ranked Indiana and Ohio State teams. Michigan lost its final home game of the season to &lt;unk&gt; on February &lt;unk&gt; to finish with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; home record. On March &lt;unk&gt;, the team defeated Illinois for their first road win in Illinois since &lt;unk&gt;. During the game, Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th of the season, Trey Burke broke Gary Grant &lt;unk&gt;s school freshman assists record, set over the course of &lt;unk&gt; games in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season, by pushing his total to &lt;unk&gt;. In the first game of the &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Conference Men &lt;unk&gt;s Basketball Tournament against Minnesota, Burke led the team to victory with a career &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points. Burke &lt;unk&gt;s total was a school record for the Big Ten Conference Men &lt;unk&gt;s Basketball Tournament. In the semifinal contest, however, Michigan was eliminated by Ohio State for the third year in a row. Michigan entered the &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Men &lt;unk&gt;s Division I Basketball Tournament &lt;unk&gt; fourth, but lost to the thirteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ohio Bobcats &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Burke became Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first Associated Press All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American &lt;unk&gt; since Robert &lt;unk&gt; and Louis &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Douglass concluded the season as the school &lt;unk&gt;s all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time leader in games played, with &lt;unk&gt;. He surpassed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who played in &lt;unk&gt; games. Novak set the school record in career minutes played with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, surpassing Louis &lt;unk&gt;, who played &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; minutes. Burke had a school record &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; setting freshman season in assists, ending the year with &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team posted the following statistics : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rankings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five of the &lt;unk&gt; nominees for the men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball Lowe &lt;unk&gt;s Senior &lt;unk&gt; Award were from the Big Ten, including Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s Zack Novak. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trey Burke was one of nearly &lt;unk&gt; Bob &lt;unk&gt; Award candidates named in December &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Burke was one of &lt;unk&gt; finalists. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Novak was named one of ten finalists for the Lowe &lt;unk&gt;s Senior &lt;unk&gt; Award along with three other Big Ten athletes. He was also one of four Big Ten men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball players named Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District, putting him among the &lt;unk&gt; finalists for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; America team. Novak was named a third team Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accolades and honors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trey Burke &lt;unk&gt; Second Team All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American Big Ten Freshman of the Year ( Big Ten media &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Freshman of the Year ( Sporting News &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( second team, coaches and media &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Freshman ( unanimous &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District &lt;unk&gt; Team Tim &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( third team, coaches and media &lt;unk&gt; Zack Novak Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American ( third team &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( honorable mention, media &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten &lt;unk&gt;osh &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Matt &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; changes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team lost senior captains &lt;unk&gt; Douglass and Zack Novak as well as senior reserve Corey Person to graduation following the season. Person was later granted an extra year of eligibility to return to the team. At the end of the season, three players ( Evan &lt;unk&gt;, Carlton &lt;unk&gt; and Colton Christian &lt;unk&gt; decided to leave the program. &lt;unk&gt;, who had started in &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; games he played in during his first two years, left the program as the program &lt;unk&gt;s fifth all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; point shooter with a percentage of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; transferred to Maryland, &lt;unk&gt; transferred to Detroit and Christian transferred to Florida International. Following the season, Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the &lt;unk&gt; NBA Draft. A few days later, however, the realization that the pool of point guards in the &lt;unk&gt; draft was shallow and Burke &lt;unk&gt;s stock was high led to some &lt;unk&gt; for him and his family : &lt;unk&gt; When you have a season as a freshman like he did, the NBA, they like them young, &lt;unk&gt; Trey &lt;unk&gt;s father, &lt;unk&gt; Burke said. &lt;unk&gt; They think their ceiling is higher when they &lt;unk&gt;re young. Trey had... a solid season for a freshman. It &lt;unk&gt;s going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years. &lt;unk&gt; Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential. Eventually, he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; team recruits &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team announced in September &lt;unk&gt; that Glenn Robinson III, son of former first overall NBA Draft pick Glenn Robinson, verbally agreed to attend Michigan, making him the first commitment in the school &lt;unk&gt;s class of &lt;unk&gt;. Canadian wing guard &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gave Michigan its second verbal commitment for the class of &lt;unk&gt; on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. On November &lt;unk&gt;, Mitch &lt;unk&gt;, who was ranked as the number &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. Within hours of the commitment, ESPN said that Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s ranked as the fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; best class in the nation. All three signed a National &lt;unk&gt; of Intent with the team on November &lt;unk&gt;. After several other schools announced their commitments, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s commitment moved Michigan from outside the top &lt;unk&gt; to the seventh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; best class in the nation, according to ESPN. Michael &lt;unk&gt; Spike &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; committed to Michigan on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Team Players &lt;unk&gt; into the NBA &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b ( abbreviated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, &lt;unk&gt; And b &lt;unk&gt;, occasionally designated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;, also named &lt;unk&gt;, is an extrasolar planet approximately &lt;unk&gt; light &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; years away from the Sun in the constellation of &lt;unk&gt;. The planet orbits the Solar twin star, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A, approximately every five days. Discovered in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; by Geoffrey &lt;unk&gt; and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot &lt;unk&gt;upiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; resolved planets to be detected directly. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the International Astronomical &lt;unk&gt;nion launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the IA&lt;unk&gt; announced the winning name was &lt;unk&gt; for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the &lt;unk&gt;ega &lt;unk&gt; Club of Morocco and honours the &lt;unk&gt;th Century astronomer Ibn al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Muslim Spain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Discovery &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b was detected by the variations in its star &lt;unk&gt;s radial velocity caused by the planet &lt;unk&gt;s gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the &lt;unk&gt; shift of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s spectrum. The planet &lt;unk&gt;s existence was announced in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, together with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b and the planet orbiting &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Like &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; days to complete an orbit, with a &lt;unk&gt; axis of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A&lt;unk&gt;. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. In the case of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, this lower limit is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the mass of &lt;unk&gt;upiter, though depending on the inclination of the orbit, the true mass may be much greater. However, astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the true mass may be about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is &lt;unk&gt; degrees. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Physical characteristics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given the planet &lt;unk&gt;s high mass, it is likely that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is a gas giant with no solid surface. The &lt;unk&gt; Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees &lt;unk&gt;, ranging from minus &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; degrees to about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees &lt;unk&gt;. The temperature difference has led to speculation that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is &lt;unk&gt; locked with the same side always facing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A. &lt;unk&gt; had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to &lt;unk&gt;upiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b to have reflective clouds of &lt;unk&gt; and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun &lt;unk&gt;s radiation ; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a &lt;unk&gt; of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, &lt;unk&gt;, hot cloud is assumed to consist of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; oxides ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; planets &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but other compounds like &lt;unk&gt; cannot be ruled out yet. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since &lt;unk&gt; forces would either &lt;unk&gt; them from orbit or destroy them on short &lt;unk&gt; compared to the age of the system. The planet ( with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b &lt;unk&gt; was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by &lt;unk&gt;. Preliminary results from &lt;unk&gt; studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; times as large and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; times as massive as &lt;unk&gt;upiter, meaning that the mean density is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm&lt;unk&gt;. It has a &lt;unk&gt; albedo of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in visible light. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on its sun &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b appears to be responsible for increased &lt;unk&gt; activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a &lt;unk&gt; hot spot &lt;unk&gt; on the star around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; away from the sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; variable stars, or the interaction between &lt;unk&gt;upiter and its moon Io.  &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Michigan highway &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the &lt;unk&gt;S state of Michigan that travels between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City. The section between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City travels through &lt;unk&gt; and along the southern edge of &lt;unk&gt; National Forest. The current version of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula by &lt;unk&gt;. The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt;arious extensions and &lt;unk&gt; have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or &lt;unk&gt; in the past. The current route was finalized in the late &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; begins at a junction with M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of &lt;unk&gt;. This junction is at a &lt;unk&gt; of county lines. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; forms the north &lt;unk&gt; south &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; county lines. B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which forms the east &lt;unk&gt; west &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; county line runs due west of the intersection. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; exits the intersection to the east. The highway runs along &lt;unk&gt;th Street through rural farms into the community of &lt;unk&gt;. The road, now called Main Street, passes through the downtown area and M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town. The highway rounds a curve and transitions to &lt;unk&gt;nd Street running eastward through more farm land. As the trunkline approaches &lt;unk&gt;, the terrain becomes more wooded near the &lt;unk&gt; River. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; follows &lt;unk&gt; Street east to a junction with M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street. South of downtown, M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns east again, independent of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and runs along &lt;unk&gt;nd Street on the southern edge of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest. The east end of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is at exit &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of Howard City. The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT &lt;unk&gt;, as a part of its maintenance responsibilities, tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways. These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT &lt;unk&gt;, which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year. In &lt;unk&gt;, the department &lt;unk&gt;s measurements indicated that a segment of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of &lt;unk&gt; had the peak volume for the highway at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles daily. The traffic nadir was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles east of &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country &lt;unk&gt;s economy, defense, and mobility. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Previous designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The first usage of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was in the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula by &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The trunkline started at M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and ran north of &lt;unk&gt; to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner. It was later replaced by M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Current designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The current M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dates back to &lt;unk&gt;. It ran from &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Hart to the northern junction of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, replacing M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In late &lt;unk&gt;, M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was extended along the section between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City, forming a M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; concurrency to fill a gap in the M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; routing. This concurrent section became just M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; back to the northern M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt;. The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart, it was continued west to end in Shelby. Two &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; rerouted the western end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from &lt;unk&gt; to New Era, bypassing Ferry. A larger change around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the highway designations in &lt;unk&gt; County. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of &lt;unk&gt;, to end at New Era instead of &lt;unk&gt;. The new M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; south of &lt;unk&gt;. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; now ran from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; only. The length of the highway was increased in &lt;unk&gt; when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to follow the &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs, and replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between Cedar Springs and &lt;unk&gt;. This freed up the &lt;unk&gt; to Howard City highway for a return to the M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation. The last change came in &lt;unk&gt; when the concurrency with M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was eliminated in favor of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of &lt;unk&gt;, resulting in the current highway routing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a fictional character in the &lt;unk&gt; manga and anime series created by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s character. Many reviewers commented on his &lt;unk&gt; and intelligence, and noted his transformation into a leader ; Anime News Network celebrated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s emergence as &lt;unk&gt; an unlikely hero &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; storyline. &lt;unk&gt; has also been highly popular with the &lt;unk&gt; reader base, placing high in several popularity polls.

In a review of episode &lt;unk&gt;, IGN praised how &lt;unk&gt; managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and agreed that the decision to make him &lt;unk&gt; was fair. Anime News Network also commented on this development, calling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s emergence as &lt;unk&gt; an unlikely hero &lt;unk&gt; one of the highlights of the arc. In a subsequent review of episode &lt;unk&gt;, in which the mission to retrieve &lt;unk&gt; has failed and the members of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s team were critically injured, IGN lauded the &lt;unk&gt; great moment &lt;unk&gt; in the episode in which &lt;unk&gt; began to cry after learning his friends will recover, and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends. &lt;unk&gt; Entertainment &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;ustin Rich celebrated his &lt;unk&gt; sheer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, calling him &lt;unk&gt; one of the most fascinating characters in the series &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; one of the few truly brilliant fighters in &lt;unk&gt; anime &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that it was &lt;unk&gt; one of the better fights involving the supporting players &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; is a state highway in the &lt;unk&gt;.S. state of New &lt;unk&gt;ersey.

Between the southern terminus and I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the route is a mix of freeway and four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through &lt;unk&gt;. This section includes a truck &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and &lt;unk&gt; Cemetery. North of I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Route &lt;unk&gt; turns into a scenic and mostly two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane highway. North of the South &lt;unk&gt; Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New &lt;unk&gt;ersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and &lt;unk&gt; County. The obsolete Delaware &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route &lt;unk&gt; are completely &lt;unk&gt; due to the tree canopy. Route &lt;unk&gt; also has a spur, Route &lt;unk&gt;, which connects Route &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;.

The route between &lt;unk&gt; and Frenchtown was originally Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Route &lt;unk&gt; was shifted to follow the alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; to avoid the &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Routes. Route &lt;unk&gt; between South Warren Street in &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt;, the southern freeway part of Route &lt;unk&gt; between I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route &lt;unk&gt; by a tunnel completed in &lt;unk&gt;. A realignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;s made the route concurrent with the entire length of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mercer County &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate &lt;unk&gt; and Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township, and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, heading to the northwest as a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane freeway. The route interchanges with Route &lt;unk&gt;, a spur of Route &lt;unk&gt; which connects to &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt;, at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to four lanes past this interchange and crosses into &lt;unk&gt;. The route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for &lt;unk&gt; Road. At this point, Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a state scenic &lt;unk&gt; that was also designated a National Scenic Byway in &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; runs along the bank of the Delaware River and enters a truck &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; restricted tunnel that passes by historic houses and &lt;unk&gt; Cemetery. Within this tunnel, Route &lt;unk&gt; features a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lalor Street. The route emerges from the tunnel as the &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway, passes by Arm &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Park, and comes to a traffic light at Thunder Road &lt;unk&gt; Cass Street where it &lt;unk&gt; back to six lanes. Route &lt;unk&gt; meets South Warren Street at another traffic light. The median &lt;unk&gt; and it passes under the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Railroad Bridge, which carries the Amtrak Northeast Corridor over the Delaware River. Route &lt;unk&gt; passes under the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge, which carries &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; over the Delaware River. &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; southbound is provided by ramps from Route &lt;unk&gt; while access to Route &lt;unk&gt; from northbound &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; is provided by South Warren Street. Route &lt;unk&gt; passes under the Lower &lt;unk&gt; Bridge and the median &lt;unk&gt; again. It interchanges with Market Street, which provides access to Route &lt;unk&gt;, and then features an interchange which provides access to the New &lt;unk&gt;ersey State House with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses the &lt;unk&gt; Creek and features an interchange which provides access to South Warren Street with exits in both directions but only a northbound entrance. Route &lt;unk&gt; continues to a cloverleaf interchange with &lt;unk&gt; Street ( County Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which provides access to the &lt;unk&gt; Street Bridge over the Delaware River. Riverside Avenue exits as a frontage road &lt;unk&gt; the northbound lanes of Route &lt;unk&gt; before the road features a northbound exit for &lt;unk&gt; Avenue. Route &lt;unk&gt; comes to a partial interchange with &lt;unk&gt; Avenue, with a northbound exit and southbound entrance, and then features a northbound exit for South &lt;unk&gt; Avenue. The freeway portion of Route &lt;unk&gt; ends at the intersection with Lee Avenue and it continues northwest along the Delaware River as a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway. The route meets the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Sullivan Way &lt;unk&gt;. The median &lt;unk&gt; again and then &lt;unk&gt; as the route meets the southern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt;, a former alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; that currently serves as a frontage road. Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses into Ewing Township and becomes the Daniel Bray Highway. It passes under the West &lt;unk&gt; Railroad Bridge, which carries &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ’ s West &lt;unk&gt; Line over the Delaware River. Route &lt;unk&gt; intersects Route &lt;unk&gt; again and then comes to a complex interchange with Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, with the ramps within the median of Route &lt;unk&gt;, just to the east of the &lt;unk&gt; Falls Bridge. &lt;unk&gt;pon crossing the Delaware and &lt;unk&gt; Canal, Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; down to a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road called River Road. It continues along the Delaware River, next to the Delaware and &lt;unk&gt; Canal, which runs between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the river. The route intersects the northern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt;. Farther north, Route &lt;unk&gt; enters &lt;unk&gt; Township and continues into a more rural setting &lt;unk&gt; with trees. Route &lt;unk&gt; heads to Washington Crossing State Park, where it intersects County Route &lt;unk&gt;, which heads east on Washington Crossing &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Road, and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge, which continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; continues north along the Delaware River through &lt;unk&gt;, passing by Washington Crossing State Park. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; County &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses into West &lt;unk&gt; Township in &lt;unk&gt; County. It enters &lt;unk&gt;, where Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway. At the intersection of South Main Street, Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes concurrent with Route &lt;unk&gt;. The route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Brunswick Street &lt;unk&gt;. It meets Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt;, where Route &lt;unk&gt; ends and Route &lt;unk&gt; turns west for a one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block wrong &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way concurrency with the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane, undivided Route &lt;unk&gt;, lasting to the intersection of Main Street, where Route &lt;unk&gt; turns north on Main Street. Route &lt;unk&gt; follows Main Street north through &lt;unk&gt;, crossing into Delaware Township. It comes to an interchange with &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; just east of the New Hope &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge, with access to northbound &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; and from southbound &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; provided by way of &lt;unk&gt; Creek Road. Route &lt;unk&gt; continues along the Delaware River and enters Stockton. The route intersects Bridge Street, which crosses the Delaware River on the Centre Bridge &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Stockton Bridge and continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route &lt;unk&gt;. Shortly after that intersection, Route &lt;unk&gt; intersects the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Stockton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Flemington Road &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses back into Delaware Township, where it meets the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Stockton Road &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road, crossing into &lt;unk&gt; Township, where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway. Here, it intersects with County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Road &lt;unk&gt;. The route &lt;unk&gt; to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles, crossing into Frenchtown, where the route becomes &lt;unk&gt; Road. &lt;unk&gt;pon entering Frenchtown, an end shield for northbound Route &lt;unk&gt; is posted to mark the end of state maintenance, which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection, where maintenance is transferred to the county. Despite this, Route &lt;unk&gt; officially continues farther north along &lt;unk&gt; Road to its northern terminus at Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt; Race Street &lt;unk&gt;, a short distance east of Route &lt;unk&gt; ’ s western terminus at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Frenchtown Bridge. The southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt; along Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The current route was originally legislated in &lt;unk&gt; as part of the Delaware River Drive, a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from &lt;unk&gt; to the New York border in &lt;unk&gt; Township. Route &lt;unk&gt; was originally defined in &lt;unk&gt; to run from &lt;unk&gt; to Newark. The original route ran from downtown &lt;unk&gt; along State Street and &lt;unk&gt; Drive. From there, it followed its current alignment to &lt;unk&gt;, where it followed present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Route &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; to present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day County Route &lt;unk&gt;, which it followed to Woods Tavern. The route turned north on &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( also designated Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and followed that route to &lt;unk&gt;, where it followed &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; to Newark. The current alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to Route &lt;unk&gt; in Frenchtown was designated Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; was eventually shifted to follow present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt;, which was also Route &lt;unk&gt; ( now Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Flemington and Route &lt;unk&gt; between Flemington and &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Route &lt;unk&gt; was planned as an extension of Route &lt;unk&gt; from Frenchtown to Route &lt;unk&gt; ( now Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Alpha. While this road was never built, much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a spur route, Route &lt;unk&gt;, was created, running along &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to the New Hope &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge. In the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering, Route &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to continue north from &lt;unk&gt; to Frenchtown on Route &lt;unk&gt;, and the Route &lt;unk&gt; designation between &lt;unk&gt; and Newark was removed in favor of &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Newark. The section of former Route &lt;unk&gt; between Route &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; became Route &lt;unk&gt;. Plans for a limited &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; access route along the Route &lt;unk&gt; corridor go back to &lt;unk&gt;, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ; this proposal never materialized. Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early &lt;unk&gt;s to construct a road, the &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway, that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township. This road was built between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; from South Warren Street in &lt;unk&gt; to present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway took up much of &lt;unk&gt; ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River. The former alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; in the northern part of &lt;unk&gt; and in Ewing Township became Route &lt;unk&gt;. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the Route &lt;unk&gt; freeway was built between the Interstate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interstate &lt;unk&gt; interchange and Route &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township. A two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane street, &lt;unk&gt; Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in &lt;unk&gt;. Construction began in &lt;unk&gt; on the Route &lt;unk&gt; freeway between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by &lt;unk&gt; but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October &lt;unk&gt; and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. A restriction to trucks over &lt;unk&gt; tons was put in place and made permanent in November &lt;unk&gt;. By the &lt;unk&gt;s, the state gave the part of Route &lt;unk&gt; ( South Main Street &lt;unk&gt; between Route &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to the city, and Route &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to use all of Route &lt;unk&gt; and one block of Route &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to this, South Main Street had been turned one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way southbound. Route &lt;unk&gt;, which is only signed on overhead street signs, still exists, though it is fully concurrent with Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the &lt;unk&gt;.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin. The ultra &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; prominent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the highest peak in the &lt;unk&gt; Range and the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest summit in the contiguous &lt;unk&gt;nited States after Mount Whitney. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is located in San Isabel National Forest, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southwest ( bearing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the City of &lt;unk&gt; in Lake County, Colorado. The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. Henry W. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak, in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; or A &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is therefore often referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; gentle giant &lt;unk&gt; that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is visible to the southwest of &lt;unk&gt;, often snow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; capped even in the summer. Many other &lt;unk&gt; surround &lt;unk&gt; in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado &lt;unk&gt;s Collegiate &lt;unk&gt;. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest in the contiguous &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount &lt;unk&gt;, Denver is about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the east, &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the north, and &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the west. &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the northeast, is the nearest large town. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount &lt;unk&gt; is the fourteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest mountain in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; and snow are possible year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; round. An electrical storm on the mountain &lt;unk&gt;s summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; issue of Science. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is part of the &lt;unk&gt; Range, an &lt;unk&gt; of the Laramide &lt;unk&gt; which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around &lt;unk&gt; million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily &lt;unk&gt;, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of &lt;unk&gt; on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and &lt;unk&gt; rocks deposited when the glaciers &lt;unk&gt;, which lie on a lateral &lt;unk&gt;. Further up the eastern side there is a large &lt;unk&gt; with a small &lt;unk&gt;. There are also lakes to both the north and south, &lt;unk&gt; and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and &lt;unk&gt; Lake was created by the &lt;unk&gt; Sugar &lt;unk&gt; Dam. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is composed largely of &lt;unk&gt;. However, the summit ridge consists of &lt;unk&gt; basement rock, which is Pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in origin and about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; billion years old. There are various igneous &lt;unk&gt; including &lt;unk&gt;, as well as &lt;unk&gt; bands &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, &lt;unk&gt; lacks both a permanent &lt;unk&gt; and a prominent north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; facing &lt;unk&gt;, which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; was named by miners in honor of Samuel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the governor of the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; tribe that opened up more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of reservation land to mining and railroad activity. The first recorded ascent of the peak was by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, who was surveying the mountain as part of the &lt;unk&gt; Survey. Originally measured as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in height, Mount &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s elevation was later adjusted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; following a re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in &lt;unk&gt; as a result of the North American &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of &lt;unk&gt; and its neighbor, Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount &lt;unk&gt; proponents &lt;unk&gt; them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount &lt;unk&gt; has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first &lt;unk&gt; ascent of &lt;unk&gt; occurred in &lt;unk&gt;, when a &lt;unk&gt;eep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Flora and fauna &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The summit of Mount &lt;unk&gt; is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( sky &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pilot &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( old &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mountain &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( alpine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Also noted are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; album, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Below &lt;unk&gt; the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine, spruce, &lt;unk&gt; and fir. Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears, &lt;unk&gt;, mule deer, &lt;unk&gt;, and pocket &lt;unk&gt; ; there are also many species of &lt;unk&gt;. Elk, grouse, turkey and &lt;unk&gt; sheep are present in the area during the summer. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are three main routes which ascend the mountain, all of which gain over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of elevation. The standard route &lt;unk&gt; the peak from the east, starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long North ( Main &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trail begins close to the &lt;unk&gt; Creek &lt;unk&gt;, and gains about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. The trail is open to &lt;unk&gt;, mountain &lt;unk&gt; and hunters during season. An easier, but longer route, the South &lt;unk&gt; Trail, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long, climbing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; at a less &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; punishing gradient than the North &lt;unk&gt; Trail, approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge. The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail, a Class &lt;unk&gt; climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace, gains &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in elevation, and also involves an ascent of the sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; peak, South &lt;unk&gt;, at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. Even healthy and experienced &lt;unk&gt; report great difficulty on this route, and despite the fact that there is a trail, the route is extremely steep, unstable, and rocky in places. The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ascent. There are also routes approaching from the western face, and southwestern ridge, from South &lt;unk&gt; Creek &lt;unk&gt; and Echo Canyon &lt;unk&gt; respectively. Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness, none of the conventional routes require specialist &lt;unk&gt; skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, even those who are &lt;unk&gt;. In serious cases, it can lead to high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; altitude pulmonary &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, &lt;unk&gt;, and death. &lt;unk&gt; are advised to begin their ascent at or before &lt;unk&gt; a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the &lt;unk&gt;, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the &lt;unk&gt;.S. government.  &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; was the tenth tropical storm of the &lt;unk&gt; Atlantic hurricane season. &lt;unk&gt; developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August &lt;unk&gt;. The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde Islands on September &lt;unk&gt;. The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; around noon the same day. Over the next several days, &lt;unk&gt; moved in a general west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September &lt;unk&gt;. Strong wind shear, some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike, and dry air caused the storm to weaken. On September &lt;unk&gt;, the combination of wind shear, dry air, and cooling waters caused &lt;unk&gt; to weaken into a tropical depression. &lt;unk&gt; deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm. The low ultimately dissipated while located &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt; on September &lt;unk&gt;. However, the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meteorological history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August &lt;unk&gt;. It tracked south of Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde and slowly developed, and on September &lt;unk&gt; the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; six hours after forming. &lt;unk&gt; was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly. &lt;unk&gt; continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical. However, due to the location of the storm, there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was &lt;unk&gt; to significantly increase due to an upper &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of &lt;unk&gt;, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September &lt;unk&gt; as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger. &lt;unk&gt; reached its peak intensity of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; around &lt;unk&gt; a.m. ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it had already begun to weaken. &lt;unk&gt; towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of &lt;unk&gt; began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center. Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as &lt;unk&gt; continued westward and no change in intensity over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and &lt;unk&gt; weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of &lt;unk&gt; was only a &lt;unk&gt; of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September &lt;unk&gt; into the morning of September &lt;unk&gt;, convection associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to &lt;unk&gt; somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong &lt;unk&gt; wind shear. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; morning, &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on &lt;unk&gt; by late morning. The convection around the system became &lt;unk&gt; from the center and &lt;unk&gt; weakened slightly. The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong &lt;unk&gt; shear. &lt;unk&gt; became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; afternoon and the storm weakened to &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;, barely holding on to tropical storm status. &lt;unk&gt; regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm &lt;unk&gt; over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with &lt;unk&gt; as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated. However, the remnant low associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September &lt;unk&gt;, wind shear took over the system again. &lt;unk&gt; around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September &lt;unk&gt;, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September &lt;unk&gt;, the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September &lt;unk&gt;, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Impact &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; As &lt;unk&gt; passed to the south of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde islands on September &lt;unk&gt;, outer rain bands produced minor rainfall, totaling around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor. Several days after the low dissipated, the remnant moisture from &lt;unk&gt; brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of rain fell. The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage was caused by the flood.  &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the twentieth spy film in the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond series, and the fourth and final film to star Pierce &lt;unk&gt; as the fictional MI&lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond. The film follows Bond as he leads a mission to North Korea, during which he is betrayed and, after seemingly killing a rogue North Korean colonel, is captured and imprisoned. Fourteen months later, Bond is released as part of a prisoner exchange. &lt;unk&gt; that someone within the British government betrayed him, he attempts to earn redemption by tracking down his &lt;unk&gt; and killing a North Korean agent he believes was involved in his torture. Die Another Day, produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee &lt;unk&gt;, marked the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond franchise &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary. The series began in &lt;unk&gt; with Sean Connery starring as Bond in Dr. No. Die Another Day includes references to each of the preceding films. The film received mixed reviews. Some critics praised the work of Lee &lt;unk&gt;, while others criticised the film &lt;unk&gt;s heavy use of computer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generated imagery, which they found &lt;unk&gt; and a distraction from the film &lt;unk&gt;s plot. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grossing &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond film up to that time if inflation is not taken into account. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; MI&lt;unk&gt; officer &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; infiltrates a North Korean military base, where Colonel Tan &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African blood &lt;unk&gt;. After Moon &lt;unk&gt;s assistant &lt;unk&gt; discovers that Bond is a British agent, the colonel attempts to kill Bond and a &lt;unk&gt; chase &lt;unk&gt;, which ends with Moon &lt;unk&gt;s apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel &lt;unk&gt;s father, General Moon. After &lt;unk&gt; months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for &lt;unk&gt; in a prisoner exchange. He is &lt;unk&gt; and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a &lt;unk&gt; Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under &lt;unk&gt;. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI&lt;unk&gt;, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that &lt;unk&gt; is in Cuba. In Havana Bond meets &lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;inx &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates &lt;unk&gt; inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but &lt;unk&gt; escapes. He leaves behind a &lt;unk&gt; which leads Bond to a &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, identified as conflict &lt;unk&gt;, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. At &lt;unk&gt; Club in London Bond meets Graves, along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI&lt;unk&gt; agent. After a fencing exercise ( and a literal sword &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fight &lt;unk&gt;, Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M &lt;unk&gt; Bond &lt;unk&gt;s Double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; status and offers assistance in the investigation. At his ice palace in Iceland Graves &lt;unk&gt; a new orbital mirror satellite, &lt;unk&gt; Icarus &lt;unk&gt;, which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; round sunshine for crop development. During the night, &lt;unk&gt;inx infiltrates Graves &lt;unk&gt; command centre, but is captured by Graves and &lt;unk&gt;. Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive. Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, assuming the identity of Gustav Graves. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing &lt;unk&gt; to escape from Graves &lt;unk&gt; facility. Bond then returns in his Aston Martin &lt;unk&gt; to rescue &lt;unk&gt;inx, who has been captured once again. &lt;unk&gt; pursues him in his own vehicle, both cars driving inside the rapidly melting ice palace. Bond kills &lt;unk&gt; by shooting an ice &lt;unk&gt; onto him, and then &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;inx after she has drowned. Bond and &lt;unk&gt;inx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and &lt;unk&gt; away on Graves &lt;unk&gt; cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the purpose of the Icarus satellite : to cut a path through the Korean &lt;unk&gt; Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the peninsula by force. &lt;unk&gt;, General Moon tries to stop the plan, but he is murdered by his own son. Bond attempts to shoot Graves but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board. In their struggle, a gunshot &lt;unk&gt; the fuselage, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and &lt;unk&gt;inx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks &lt;unk&gt;inx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, &lt;unk&gt;inx kills Frost.

The film was shot primarily in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, Iceland, and &lt;unk&gt;, Spain. Other locations included &lt;unk&gt; Studios &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stage and Maui, Hawaii, in December &lt;unk&gt;. Laird Hamilton, Dave &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performed the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; title surfing scene at the surf break known as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Maui, while the shore shots were taken near &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves &lt;unk&gt; diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional &lt;unk&gt; de Los &lt;unk&gt; were filmed at La &lt;unk&gt;, Spain. The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in &lt;unk&gt;. The location was reportedly cold and &lt;unk&gt;, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick &lt;unk&gt; between takes to avoid catching a &lt;unk&gt;. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minute operation. &lt;unk&gt; and other props from every previous Bond film and stored in &lt;unk&gt; Productions &lt;unk&gt; archives appear in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s warehouse in the London &lt;unk&gt;nderground. Examples include the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and Rosa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s poison &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped shoe in From Russia with Love. &lt;unk&gt; mentions that the watch he issues Bond is &lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;th, I believe &lt;unk&gt;, a reference to Die Another Day being the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced Bond film. In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the &lt;unk&gt; Club, MI&lt;unk&gt; Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. Svalbard, Norway and &lt;unk&gt;, Iceland were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at &lt;unk&gt; National Park, Norway and RAF Little &lt;unk&gt;, Gloucestershire ; &lt;unk&gt; Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the &lt;unk&gt; cargo plane scenes. The scene in which Bond &lt;unk&gt; the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene are computer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generated. The hangar interior of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S Air Base in South Korea &lt;unk&gt;, shown crowded with &lt;unk&gt; helicopters, was filmed at RAF &lt;unk&gt; in Hampshire, &lt;unk&gt;K, as were the helicopter interior shots during the &lt;unk&gt; sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a &lt;unk&gt;S base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, &lt;unk&gt; ( one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape &lt;unk&gt; are flown by Bond and &lt;unk&gt;inx to &lt;unk&gt; enter North Korea.

The good guys get in &lt;unk&gt;, thanks to a fast cruise, good &lt;unk&gt; performance, and minimal radar signature. It &lt;unk&gt;s a wonderful promotion for the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records. He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for The World Is Not Enough. The first, originally used as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s theme, is heard during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the &lt;unk&gt; Christmas in Turkey &lt;unk&gt; track of The World Is Not Enough, is reused in the &lt;unk&gt; Going Down Together &lt;unk&gt; track. The title song for Die Another Day was co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; written and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo in the film as &lt;unk&gt;, a fencing instructor. This is the first Bond title sequence to directly reflect the film &lt;unk&gt;s plot since Dr. No ; all the other previous Bond titles are stand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; alone set pieces. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive &lt;unk&gt; months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics &lt;unk&gt; opinions of the song were sharply divided &lt;unk&gt; it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the &lt;unk&gt; Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, but also for a Golden &lt;unk&gt; Award for &lt;unk&gt; Original Song of &lt;unk&gt; ( while Madonna herself won the Golden &lt;unk&gt; Award for &lt;unk&gt; Supporting Actress for her cameo &lt;unk&gt;. In a &lt;unk&gt; poll for the Channel &lt;unk&gt; programme &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt;s Greatest Hits &lt;unk&gt;, the song was voted &lt;unk&gt;th out of &lt;unk&gt;, and also came in as an &lt;unk&gt; overwhelming number one &lt;unk&gt; favourite among those under the age of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Marketing tie &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; MGM and &lt;unk&gt; Productions granted Mattel the license to sell a line of Barbie dolls based around the franchise. Mattel announced that the Bond &lt;unk&gt; will be at her &lt;unk&gt; stylish best &lt;unk&gt;, clad in evening dress and red &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; created the dress, which is &lt;unk&gt; to the thigh to reveal a telephone &lt;unk&gt; to Barbie &lt;unk&gt;s leg. The doll was sold in a gift set, with Barbie &lt;unk&gt;s boyfriend Ken posing as Bond in a &lt;unk&gt; designed by the Italian fashion house &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; also collaborated with the makers of Die Another Day to create a cosmetics line based around the character &lt;unk&gt;inx. The limited edition &lt;unk&gt; Colour Collection was launched on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; to coincide with the film &lt;unk&gt;s release. The product names were loaded with puns and &lt;unk&gt;, with shades and textures ranging from the &lt;unk&gt; warm &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; cool and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day had its world premiere on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; at the Royal Albert Hall in London. &lt;unk&gt;ueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, making it the second Bond film premiere to be attended by the &lt;unk&gt;ueen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in &lt;unk&gt;. The Royal Albert Hall had a make &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were donated to the Cinema and Television &lt;unk&gt; Fund of which the &lt;unk&gt;ueen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. Die Another Day was the highest grossing &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond film until the release of Casino &lt;unk&gt;. It earned &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest grossing film of &lt;unk&gt;. Die Another Day became a controversial subject in eastern Asia. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hungry. The South Koreans boycotted &lt;unk&gt; theatres where it was released on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a &lt;unk&gt; scene near a statue of the Buddha. The &lt;unk&gt; Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics &lt;unk&gt;. The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was &lt;unk&gt; the wrong film at the wrong time. &lt;unk&gt; The amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism, specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC, Time and Reuters who all used the pun &lt;unk&gt; Buy Another Day &lt;unk&gt;. Reportedly &lt;unk&gt; companies, paying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, had their products featured in the film, a record at the time, although &lt;unk&gt;SA Today reported that number to be as high as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. By choice, the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next Bond film Casino &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Rotten Tomatoes listed Die Another Day with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating. Metacritic gave the film a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; rating, representing &lt;unk&gt; mixed or average reviews. &lt;unk&gt; Michael &lt;unk&gt; of Film &lt;unk&gt; praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory. &lt;unk&gt; Larry Carroll of &lt;unk&gt; praised Lee &lt;unk&gt; for having &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also &lt;unk&gt; a new &lt;unk&gt; to it all. &lt;unk&gt; Entertainment Weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a true filmmaker &lt;unk&gt;, has re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; established the series &lt;unk&gt; pop &lt;unk&gt;. Dana Stevens of The New York Times called the film the best of the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond series since The Spy Who Loved Me. Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks &lt;unk&gt; stated in his review that the &lt;unk&gt; first half of Die Another Day is classic Bond &lt;unk&gt;, but that &lt;unk&gt; Things start to go &lt;unk&gt; when the ice palace gets introduced. &lt;unk&gt; However, Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on &lt;unk&gt; and special effects, with the plot being neglected. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; This is a train wreck of an action film &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; attempt by the filmmakers to force &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; feed &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond into the mindless &lt;unk&gt; mold and throw &lt;unk&gt; years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Of the action sequences, he said, &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and &lt;unk&gt; bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with &lt;unk&gt; production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as &lt;unk&gt; the seemingly non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string. &lt;unk&gt; Roger Moore remarked, &lt;unk&gt; I thought it just went too far &lt;unk&gt; and that ’ s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; current official &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal &lt;unk&gt; and Robert Wade. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent &lt;unk&gt;s adventures as a teenager, by Charlie &lt;unk&gt;, was launched in &lt;unk&gt;. As the &lt;unk&gt; was published after Benson &lt;unk&gt;s final original &lt;unk&gt; novel, The Man with the Red &lt;unk&gt;, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to mark the &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary of Fleming &lt;unk&gt;s birth. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arose in &lt;unk&gt; of a spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off film concentrating on &lt;unk&gt;inx, which was scheduled for a November &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a &lt;unk&gt; winter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alternative to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt;. In the late &lt;unk&gt;s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off film based on Michelle Yeoh &lt;unk&gt;s character, &lt;unk&gt; Lin, in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Tomorrow Never Dies. However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ariety reported that MGM had completely pulled the &lt;unk&gt; on this project, to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of &lt;unk&gt; Entertainment, who were reported to be &lt;unk&gt; clearly furious &lt;unk&gt; about the decision. MGM were keen to instead move on with the next film, Casino &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( born May &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a Welsh actress, best known for her role as &lt;unk&gt; Tyson in the BBC medical drama &lt;unk&gt; City.

She is married to fellow actor Adam &lt;unk&gt;, with whom she has two daughters. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was born in Cardiff, Wales in May &lt;unk&gt;, to a Sierra &lt;unk&gt; mother and a &lt;unk&gt; father. She was raised by her mother &lt;unk&gt;s cousin and his wife in Ely, Cardiff. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s heritage means she is &lt;unk&gt; by descent, although she does not speak the language. &lt;unk&gt; studied at Windsor Clive Primary and &lt;unk&gt; Ely High School, and was a member of the &lt;unk&gt; Youth Theatre, South Glamorgan Youth Theatre, South Glamorgan Youth Choir and the National Youth Theatre of Wales. She left high school before sitting her A Levels in order to pursue her ambition of becoming an actress. She explains : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve always wanted to act. I decided at &lt;unk&gt; I wanted to make my living acting, but even if I couldn &lt;unk&gt;t, I ’ d be in an amateur theatre company. &lt;unk&gt; She then went on to attend the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, studying for a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year acting &lt;unk&gt;. Her first acting role was for the Welsh &lt;unk&gt; when still at primary school, playing a lady &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; waiting at the court of King Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; has stated that it was &lt;unk&gt; Streisand &lt;unk&gt;s performance in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;! that inspired her to act as a child, though credits her adoptive mother with encouraging her to act professionally. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first job was selling &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; Road Market in Cardiff. She worked as a &lt;unk&gt; whilst attending drama school, and, six weeks prior to graduation, was offered a job with the &lt;unk&gt; Made in Wales &lt;unk&gt; theatre company which enabled her to obtain her union card. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; began her career in the theatre, performing in a number of Shakespearean plays including Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night &lt;unk&gt;s Dream, The Tempest, The &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;enice and Macbeth. She states of this : &lt;unk&gt; Shakespeare keeps coming my way. I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I &lt;unk&gt;ll ever be &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and &lt;unk&gt;iola. She explains : &lt;unk&gt; The role of &lt;unk&gt;iola didn &lt;unk&gt;t sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense. &lt;unk&gt; She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ueen of &lt;unk&gt; at the Globe Theatre in London in &lt;unk&gt;, which she described as &lt;unk&gt; a dream of a part &lt;unk&gt;. She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first film appearance was in the &lt;unk&gt; film Great &lt;unk&gt; in Aviation, written by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which she starred alongside &lt;unk&gt;onathan Pryce and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hurt. &lt;unk&gt;ariety magazine &lt;unk&gt;s David &lt;unk&gt; said of her performance : &lt;unk&gt; In the film &lt;unk&gt;s most &lt;unk&gt; turn, &lt;unk&gt; is a constant pleasure to watch. &lt;unk&gt; and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the &lt;unk&gt; fireworks momentarily back down to Earth. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recalls having been &lt;unk&gt; at the prospect of working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a &lt;unk&gt; wonderful experience &lt;unk&gt;. Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret &lt;unk&gt; of Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, filmed in Morocco whilst &lt;unk&gt; was pregnant with her first child, starring &lt;unk&gt; Cruz. &lt;unk&gt; says of her film career : &lt;unk&gt; I really like doing film &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first prolific television role was in the IT&lt;unk&gt; drama Soldier Soldier, in which she starred throughout its third series in &lt;unk&gt; as soldier &lt;unk&gt;s wife Bernie Roberts. &lt;unk&gt; credits her chemistry with co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; star &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who played her on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen husband Luke Roberts, for winning her her audition. She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett, and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay. She has spoken critically of the way the BBC treated the soap, moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series. She acted alongside Pauline &lt;unk&gt; in both &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Being April, deeming &lt;unk&gt; to be a &lt;unk&gt; fantastic &lt;unk&gt; actress, and one she would work alongside again &lt;unk&gt; like a shot &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; appeared at the National Theatre in Helen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s adaptation of Leo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s War and Peace. In &lt;unk&gt;, she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow, alongside poet Owen &lt;unk&gt; and performance artist Mark Rees. She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show &lt;unk&gt;s launch, and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series. She has since concluded that &lt;unk&gt; the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren &lt;unk&gt;t really into watching T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but at the time was outspoken against the show &lt;unk&gt;s cancellation, stating : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s other notable television appearances include the BBC psychological thriller Green &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Eyed Monster ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, soap opera &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Waking the Dead ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, London &lt;unk&gt;s Burning ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Murder in Mind ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Canterbury Tales ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Sea of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, she starred in the Doctor Who episode &lt;unk&gt; Midnight &lt;unk&gt;, playing an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alongside David Tennant &lt;unk&gt;s Tenth Doctor. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; starred in the &lt;unk&gt; musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated : &lt;unk&gt; The script made me laugh out loud when I read it. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I also like the fact that there were a lot of politically &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; correct boxes being &lt;unk&gt;, but the writers and producer haven &lt;unk&gt;t been restrained by that. &lt;unk&gt; So, instead of &lt;unk&gt; to this altar, they &lt;unk&gt;ve said, &lt;unk&gt; Okay, we have this family that &lt;unk&gt;s half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; black, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who &lt;unk&gt;s mixed &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; raced and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but we &lt;unk&gt;re not going to be restrained by any of that. We &lt;unk&gt;re not going to &lt;unk&gt; around Martha &lt;unk&gt;s disability or anything. &lt;unk&gt; I liked that. It wasn &lt;unk&gt;t some sort of &lt;unk&gt; hands &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off approach to what we &lt;unk&gt;re presenting. &lt;unk&gt; She has also been cast in the film &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; starred in BBC medical drama &lt;unk&gt; City as nurse &lt;unk&gt; Tyson. She had previously appeared in &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt;s sister show &lt;unk&gt;, and had made an appearance in &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt;s fifth series as patient &lt;unk&gt; Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director &lt;unk&gt;ulie &lt;unk&gt;. After a series of three meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of &lt;unk&gt;, despite being &lt;unk&gt; nervous about signing such a long contract &lt;unk&gt;, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve been someone who &lt;unk&gt;s loved the uncertainty of acting. I &lt;unk&gt;ve loved that one month it &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; in Morocco and the next I &lt;unk&gt;m doing a stage play, then it &lt;unk&gt;s a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part &lt;unk&gt; thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I &lt;unk&gt;m going to be a working mum I &lt;unk&gt;d rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then &lt;unk&gt; came along, so I &lt;unk&gt;m very grateful &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; signed a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year contract to play &lt;unk&gt;, and described herself as &lt;unk&gt; very similar &lt;unk&gt; to her character, speaking positively about her working relationship with co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stars &lt;unk&gt;aye &lt;unk&gt; and Sharon D. Clarke, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; dream &lt;unk&gt; storylines her character was given. She said of the show : &lt;unk&gt; I really love &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;m surprised how much. What thrills me about &lt;unk&gt; is that you get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it &lt;unk&gt;s about more than turning up and saying the lines. It &lt;unk&gt;s about understanding it and trying to make it better. That &lt;unk&gt;s actually a lot of fun. What &lt;unk&gt;s great is nobody says, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ust shut up. &lt;unk&gt; They want you to work at it. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, &lt;unk&gt; do I want to do something else? &lt;unk&gt; but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘ &lt;unk&gt; ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work. &lt;unk&gt; In October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; announced that she would be departing from &lt;unk&gt; City in order to have a second child, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve had a great time and I &lt;unk&gt;ll miss it. I made the decision purely because I was pregnant, but I wasn &lt;unk&gt;t really ready to put down the character of &lt;unk&gt;. I &lt;unk&gt;m very sorry to have to let her go. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race and charity work &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Throughout her career, &lt;unk&gt; has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states : &lt;unk&gt; I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining ; &lt;unk&gt; If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; They are not being sold as a reason to watch. &lt;unk&gt; She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I could not have played any of the roles I have played on T&lt;unk&gt; if I was white &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it &lt;unk&gt;s still very low and expectations are still very low &lt;unk&gt;. She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that : &lt;unk&gt; I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they &lt;unk&gt;re never Welsh. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called &lt;unk&gt; Park or &lt;unk&gt; Close I wouldn &lt;unk&gt;t have been in it &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; founded a production company and directed a short film entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with &lt;unk&gt; stating : &lt;unk&gt; it just made me decide that if there &lt;unk&gt;s anything I don &lt;unk&gt;t want to do, it &lt;unk&gt;s produce films, because I &lt;unk&gt;m rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end. &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; offered her support to the Action for Southern Africa campaign &lt;unk&gt;! Period, aiming to provide affordable &lt;unk&gt; protection to &lt;unk&gt; women. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was nominated and shortlisted for the &lt;unk&gt; Female Performance in T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; award in the &lt;unk&gt; Screen Nation Awards, for her role as &lt;unk&gt; Tyson in &lt;unk&gt; City. She received Honourable Mention for the same role the following year, and was shortlisted again in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; voted &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; woman in Wales, saying of her : &lt;unk&gt; One of our favourite &lt;unk&gt;, she &lt;unk&gt;s black, beautiful and the term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mummy &lt;unk&gt; should have been made for her. &lt;unk&gt; She placed &lt;unk&gt;th in &lt;unk&gt;, with the Western Mail noting : &lt;unk&gt; the last &lt;unk&gt; years have only seen &lt;unk&gt; become more beautiful and more successful &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; placed &lt;unk&gt;th in the awards in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Personal life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; describes herself as &lt;unk&gt; optimistic, cynical, lazy, naive &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; honest &lt;unk&gt;. She spends her free time &lt;unk&gt; watching television, the theatre, cinema, concerts, indoor wall climbing &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; keeping fit &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; aerobics &lt;unk&gt;. She has a collection of &lt;unk&gt; dolls which she keeps under her bath. &lt;unk&gt; has an interest in travel, and has visited Peru and Kenya among other destinations. She has expressed a desire to visit Brazil and Argentina, and has &lt;unk&gt; a romantic notion of travelling around Europe in a &lt;unk&gt; van &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; often speaks of her pride in her Welsh upbringing, describing herself as &lt;unk&gt; an Ely girl through and through &lt;unk&gt;. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in &lt;unk&gt;. During a &lt;unk&gt; production of Hamlet, &lt;unk&gt; met her future husband, fellow actor Adam &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; son of Love &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; star &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt;. They met again two years later, during a production of Twelfth Night, and went on to become a couple. The pair married in May &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; gave birth to their first daughter in &lt;unk&gt;uly that year. Their second daughter was born in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filmography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has undertaken the following roles from her screen and &lt;unk&gt; debut in &lt;unk&gt;, to the present day. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Film roles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Television roles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge, Battle of Raiders Ridge, and Battle of the Ridge, was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II between Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army and Allied ( mainly &lt;unk&gt;nited States Marine Corps &lt;unk&gt; ground forces. It took place from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; in the Solomon Islands, and was the second of three separate major &lt;unk&gt;apanese ground offensives during the &lt;unk&gt; Campaign. In the battle, &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines, under the overall command of &lt;unk&gt;.S. Major General Alexander &lt;unk&gt;, repulsed an attack by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade, under the command of &lt;unk&gt;apanese Major General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Marines were defending the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on &lt;unk&gt;, which was captured from the &lt;unk&gt;apanese by the Allies in landings on &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit was sent to &lt;unk&gt; in response to the Allied landings with the mission of &lt;unk&gt; the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island. &lt;unk&gt; the strength of Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the &lt;unk&gt;.S. defenses. The main &lt;unk&gt;apanese assault occurred around &lt;unk&gt; ridge south of Henderson Field, manned by troops from several &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine Corps units, primarily troops from the &lt;unk&gt;st &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute Battalions under &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. &lt;unk&gt;. Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack was ultimately defeated, with heavy losses for the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. Because of the key participation by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit in defending the ridge, the ridge was commonly referred to as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources. After &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese continued to send troops to &lt;unk&gt; for further attempts to retake Henderson Field, affecting &lt;unk&gt;apanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; campaign &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, Allied forces ( primarily &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt; landed on &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the &lt;unk&gt;.S. and Australia. They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; month &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long &lt;unk&gt; campaign. Taking the &lt;unk&gt;apanese by surprise, by nightfall on &lt;unk&gt; August the Allied landing forces had secured &lt;unk&gt; and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at &lt;unk&gt; Point ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; on the north shore of the island of &lt;unk&gt; east of the present day capital of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; placed his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops of the &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Division on &lt;unk&gt; in a loose perimeter around the &lt;unk&gt; Point area. On &lt;unk&gt; August, the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major &lt;unk&gt; Henderson, a Marine &lt;unk&gt; who had been killed at the Battle of Midway. The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air Force &lt;unk&gt; after the Allied code name for &lt;unk&gt;. In response to the Allied landings on &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Army &lt;unk&gt; a corps &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized command based at Rabaul ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; and under the command of Lieutenant &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the task of retaking &lt;unk&gt; from Allied forces. The &lt;unk&gt;th Army &lt;unk&gt; heavily involved with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese campaign in New Guinea &lt;unk&gt; had only a few units available to send to the southern &lt;unk&gt; area. Of these units, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade &lt;unk&gt; under Major General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was at &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the &lt;unk&gt;th ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment &lt;unk&gt; under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was embarked on transport ships near Guam. The different units began to move toward &lt;unk&gt; immediately ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s regiment &lt;unk&gt; the closest &lt;unk&gt; arrived first. The &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; consisting of about &lt;unk&gt; soldiers &lt;unk&gt; landed from destroyers at &lt;unk&gt; Point ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter, on August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; the strength of Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s First &lt;unk&gt; conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at &lt;unk&gt; Creek on the east side of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter in the early morning hours of August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; : all but &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; men of the First &lt;unk&gt; ( including &lt;unk&gt; himself &lt;unk&gt; were killed in the battle. The survivors returned to &lt;unk&gt; Point, notified &lt;unk&gt;th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul. By &lt;unk&gt; August, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit had reached &lt;unk&gt; and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to &lt;unk&gt;. Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese decided not to deliver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops to &lt;unk&gt; by slow transport ship ; instead, the ships carrying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers were sent to Rabaul. From there, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese planned to deliver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men to &lt;unk&gt; by destroyers, staging through a &lt;unk&gt;apanese naval base in the &lt;unk&gt; Islands. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and back in a single night, &lt;unk&gt; their exposure to Allied air attack. However, most of the soldiers &lt;unk&gt; heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, could not be taken to &lt;unk&gt; with them. These high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speed destroyer runs to &lt;unk&gt;, which occurred throughout the campaign, were later called the &lt;unk&gt; Tokyo Express &lt;unk&gt; by Allied forces and &lt;unk&gt; Rat Transportation &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies. However, any &lt;unk&gt;apanese ship remaining within the &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks. This &lt;unk&gt; curious tactical situation &lt;unk&gt; held for several months. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; movement &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; August, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops were loaded onto the destroyers &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, designated Destroyer Division &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Because of a shortage of fuel, &lt;unk&gt; could not make the entire round trip to &lt;unk&gt; at high speed in one night, but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which &lt;unk&gt; fuel. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; that day, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. dive bombers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; under the command of Lt. Col. Richard &lt;unk&gt;, flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; north of &lt;unk&gt;, sinking &lt;unk&gt; and heavily damaging &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; took &lt;unk&gt; in tow and the three destroyers returned to the &lt;unk&gt; without completing their mission. The attack on &lt;unk&gt; killed &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers and &lt;unk&gt; crew members. Subsequent &lt;unk&gt; Express &lt;unk&gt; runs were more successful. Between &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; September, various &lt;unk&gt;apanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol boats were able to land almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops at &lt;unk&gt; Point, including all of the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade, one battalion of the &lt;unk&gt; Regiment, and the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s regiment. General &lt;unk&gt;, who landed at &lt;unk&gt; Point on the &lt;unk&gt; August Express run, was placed in command of all the &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops on &lt;unk&gt;. On the night of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, as three of the Express destroyers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops, they detected and sank two &lt;unk&gt;.S. ships in the vicinity, the small, old destroyer transports ( called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;SS Little and Gregory that were used to &lt;unk&gt; Allied troops around the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; area. In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs, &lt;unk&gt; insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to &lt;unk&gt; by slow barges. Therefore, a convoy carrying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops and heavy equipment in &lt;unk&gt; barges, mainly from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy, killing about &lt;unk&gt; of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit &lt;unk&gt;s heavy equipment. Most of the remaining &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops were able to land near &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;, west of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter over the next few days. By &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; had &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops at &lt;unk&gt; Point and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. &lt;unk&gt; was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the &lt;unk&gt;th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces. &lt;unk&gt; believed that there were only about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines on &lt;unk&gt;. During this time, &lt;unk&gt; continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. Between &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; September, he relocated three Marine battalions &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt;st &lt;unk&gt; Battalion, under &lt;unk&gt;.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute Battalion &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. These units added about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s original &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men defending Henderson Field. The &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in August, was placed under &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s command. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prelude &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; set the date for his attack on the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter for &lt;unk&gt; September and began marching his forces west from &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; Point on &lt;unk&gt; September. He &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on &lt;unk&gt; September, and that naval warships be stationed off &lt;unk&gt; Point on September &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island. &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; issued his attack plan to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the enemy in the vicinity of the &lt;unk&gt; Island airfield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plan called for his forces to split into three, approach the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter inland, and launch a surprise night attack. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force would attack the perimeter from the west while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; renamed the &lt;unk&gt; Battalion &lt;unk&gt; would attack from the east. The main attack would be by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Center Body &lt;unk&gt;, numbering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men in three battalions, from the south of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. By &lt;unk&gt; September, most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops had started marching from &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; Point along the coastline. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade &lt;unk&gt;s supply base at &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, native island scouts &lt;unk&gt; directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands &lt;unk&gt; Defence Force, Martin &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; told the Marines of &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops at &lt;unk&gt;, near the village of &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; launched a raid against the &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops at &lt;unk&gt;. Destroyer transports &lt;unk&gt;SS McKean and &lt;unk&gt; and two patrol boats took &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men to &lt;unk&gt; in two trips. &lt;unk&gt; and his first wave of &lt;unk&gt; troops landed at &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; ( local time &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September. &lt;unk&gt; by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men advanced towards &lt;unk&gt; village but were slowed by &lt;unk&gt;apanese resistance. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force pushed into the village. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese defenders, believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards &lt;unk&gt; Point, retreated into the jungle, leaving behind &lt;unk&gt; dead. Two Marines were killed. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops discovered the supply base for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces, including large &lt;unk&gt; of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a &lt;unk&gt; radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, and returned to the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack. &lt;unk&gt; and Colonel Gerald Thomas, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s operations officer, believed that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack would come at the &lt;unk&gt; Ridge, a narrow, grassy, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd &lt;unk&gt; long, coral ridge ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; parallel to the &lt;unk&gt; River just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural &lt;unk&gt; of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. &lt;unk&gt; and Thomas tried to persuade &lt;unk&gt; to move forces to defend the ridge, but &lt;unk&gt; refused, believing that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced &lt;unk&gt; that the ridge was a good location for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders to &lt;unk&gt; rest &lt;unk&gt; from their actions of the preceding month. On &lt;unk&gt; September, the &lt;unk&gt; men of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt;st Raiders and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Center Body of troops was planning to attack the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter at the ridge, which they called &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; because of its shape. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops left the coast at &lt;unk&gt; Point. &lt;unk&gt; into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their &lt;unk&gt; attack points south and southeast of the airfield. &lt;unk&gt; of good maps, at least one faulty &lt;unk&gt;, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the &lt;unk&gt;apanese columns to proceed slowly and &lt;unk&gt;, costing a lot of time. At the same time, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops approached the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter from the west. &lt;unk&gt; had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, extracted from a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Army pilot captured on &lt;unk&gt; August. During the day of &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night &lt;unk&gt;s attacks. &lt;unk&gt; wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, but they did not reach their assembly areas until after &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the &lt;unk&gt; battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, &lt;unk&gt; was still confident in his attack plan because a captured &lt;unk&gt;.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. &lt;unk&gt;apanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, causing a few casualties, including two killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First night &lt;unk&gt;s action &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Americans knew of the approach of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols, but did not know exactly where or when they would attack. The ridge around which &lt;unk&gt; deployed his men consisted of three distinct &lt;unk&gt;. At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill &lt;unk&gt; ( so named because it rose &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above sea level &lt;unk&gt;. Six hundred yards north was Hill &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;, the dominant feature on the ridge. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was unnamed and about &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high. &lt;unk&gt; placed the five companies from the &lt;unk&gt; battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side, holding positions in depth from Hill &lt;unk&gt; back to Hill &lt;unk&gt;. Two of the five &lt;unk&gt; companies, &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;, held a line between the ridge, a small, swampy &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; River. Machine &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun teams from &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; Company, the heavy weapons company, were scattered throughout the defenses. &lt;unk&gt; placed his command post on Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese cruiser &lt;unk&gt; and three destroyers shelled the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter for &lt;unk&gt; minutes and illuminated the ridge with a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops began &lt;unk&gt; with Marines around the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;st Battalion &lt;unk&gt; led by Major &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attacked the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; company between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; River, overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit became entangled with troops from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack on the ridge that night. &lt;unk&gt;, who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops &lt;unk&gt; attacks, later complained, &lt;unk&gt; Due to the &lt;unk&gt; jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless. &lt;unk&gt; Twelve &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines were killed ; &lt;unk&gt;apanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both &lt;unk&gt; in the west and the &lt;unk&gt; unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn. At first light on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge, forcing any &lt;unk&gt;apanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second night &lt;unk&gt;s action on the ridge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese to attack again that night, &lt;unk&gt; directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge. After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to &lt;unk&gt; the night before, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; his forces. He pulled his front back about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to a line that stretched &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;, starting at the &lt;unk&gt; River and crossing the ridge about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; south of Hill &lt;unk&gt;. Around and behind Hill &lt;unk&gt; he placed five companies. Any &lt;unk&gt;apanese attackers &lt;unk&gt; Hill &lt;unk&gt; would have to advance over &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill &lt;unk&gt;. With only a few hours to prepare, the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications. They were low on ammunition, with one or two grenades for each Marine. &lt;unk&gt; ordered a reserve force consisting of the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to move into a position just to the rear of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops. In addition, a battery of four &lt;unk&gt; howitzers from the &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s front line units. Late in the afternoon, &lt;unk&gt; stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying, You men have done a great job, and I have just one more thing to ask of you. &lt;unk&gt; out just one more night. I know we &lt;unk&gt;ve been without sleep a long time. But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here. I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s speech &lt;unk&gt; raised the spirits &lt;unk&gt; of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead. As the sun set on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Marines with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops of his brigade, plus an assortment of light artillery. The night was pitch black, with no moon. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, seven &lt;unk&gt;apanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack began just after nightfall, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion assaulting &lt;unk&gt; Company B on the Marine right flank, just to the west of the ridge. The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nder Marine artillery fire, &lt;unk&gt; reassembled his men and continued his attack. Without &lt;unk&gt; to try to &lt;unk&gt; roll &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the &lt;unk&gt; River, heading for the airfield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations. Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, they paused to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; themselves &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; rations. &lt;unk&gt; ordered his men to continue the attack. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield, as well as Hill &lt;unk&gt;. In the heavy fighting that followed, &lt;unk&gt; and around &lt;unk&gt; of his men were killed, ending that attack. Meanwhile, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, under Major &lt;unk&gt; Tamura, assembled for their planned assault against Hill &lt;unk&gt; from the jungle south of the ridge. Marine observers spotted Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s preparations and called in artillery fire. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, a barrage from twelve &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; guns hit Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s position. In response, two companies of Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s troops &lt;unk&gt; numbering about &lt;unk&gt; men &lt;unk&gt; charged up Hill &lt;unk&gt; with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades. Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also &lt;unk&gt; Company B, pushing the &lt;unk&gt; off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the &lt;unk&gt;. To protect the exposed &lt;unk&gt; Company B, &lt;unk&gt; immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At the same time, a &lt;unk&gt;apanese company from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. &lt;unk&gt; that their positions were now &lt;unk&gt;, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill &lt;unk&gt;. In the darkness and confusion of the battle, the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized. A few Marines began &lt;unk&gt; that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were attacking with poison gas, &lt;unk&gt; other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks. After arriving behind Hill &lt;unk&gt;, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word &lt;unk&gt; withdraw &lt;unk&gt; to anyone within &lt;unk&gt;. Other Marines began to follow them. &lt;unk&gt;ust at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Major Kenneth D. Bailey from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s staff, and other Marine officers appeared and, with &lt;unk&gt; vivid &lt;unk&gt; language, &lt;unk&gt; the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill &lt;unk&gt;. As the Marines formed into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped line around Hill &lt;unk&gt;, Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill &lt;unk&gt; and up from below the east side of the ridge. &lt;unk&gt;nder the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s men. Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s troops &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regimental &lt;unk&gt; gun to the top of Hill &lt;unk&gt; in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which &lt;unk&gt; could have turned the tide in favor of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese, &lt;unk&gt; however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, &lt;unk&gt; ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill &lt;unk&gt; to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the &lt;unk&gt; swept forward, killing &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill &lt;unk&gt;, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that &lt;unk&gt; for a moment and then &lt;unk&gt; the harder... When one wave was &lt;unk&gt; down - and I mean &lt;unk&gt; down - another followed it into death. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese hit &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s left flank just after the &lt;unk&gt; took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle, machine &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun, mortar, and grenade fire. Marine &lt;unk&gt; mm and &lt;unk&gt; mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking &lt;unk&gt;apanese. A captured &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldier later said that his unit was &lt;unk&gt; annihilated &lt;unk&gt; by the Marine artillery fire, which only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of his company survived. By &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; several more assaults, some of which resulted in hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand fighting, and severe sniper fire from all sides, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men were joined by troops from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment, who helped repulse two more &lt;unk&gt;apanese attacks before dawn. Throughout the night, as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, &lt;unk&gt; remained standing about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; behind the Marine firing line on Hill &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain &lt;unk&gt; Smith, who was in position to observe &lt;unk&gt; for most of the night, &lt;unk&gt; I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together, &lt;unk&gt; did it that night. He stood just behind the front lines &lt;unk&gt; stood, when most of us &lt;unk&gt; the ground. &lt;unk&gt; During the heavy fighting, portions of three &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies, including two from Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s and one from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalions, &lt;unk&gt; the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of &lt;unk&gt; Fighter One &lt;unk&gt;, a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one &lt;unk&gt;apanese company &lt;unk&gt;s advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. When no reinforcements joined them, both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after &lt;unk&gt;. Most of the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night. As the sun rose on &lt;unk&gt; September, pockets of &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge. But with Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion shattered after losing &lt;unk&gt; of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill &lt;unk&gt;, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At first light, three &lt;unk&gt;.S. Army aircraft from the &lt;unk&gt;th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese near Hill &lt;unk&gt; and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; attacks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; As the battle on the ridge took place, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. The &lt;unk&gt; battalion &lt;unk&gt; led by Major Takeshi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attacked the southeastern sector of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter, defended by Marines of the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. &lt;unk&gt; was killed in the attack. After &lt;unk&gt;, the Marines, believing that the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion was still in the area, sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines ; four &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them. After abandoning their burning tanks, several of the disabled tanks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; and killed by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. One tank &lt;unk&gt; down an embankment into the &lt;unk&gt; River, drowning its crew. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, the remnants of the &lt;unk&gt; battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but were repulsed. A final &lt;unk&gt; weak &lt;unk&gt; attack by the &lt;unk&gt; unit on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; September was also defeated. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit of about &lt;unk&gt; men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, two &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies attacked positions held by the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another &lt;unk&gt;apanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; September. The rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the &lt;unk&gt; River valley to join with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit, a &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; march over difficult terrain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops began the march on the morning of &lt;unk&gt; September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to &lt;unk&gt; their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s positions at &lt;unk&gt; five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The &lt;unk&gt; battalion &lt;unk&gt;s survivors, attempting to follow &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost &lt;unk&gt; to death before finally reaching &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s camp. In total, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces lost about &lt;unk&gt; killed in the attack, including &lt;unk&gt; in Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force, &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; battalion, and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the &lt;unk&gt;. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese dead, including &lt;unk&gt; on the slopes of Hill &lt;unk&gt;. The Marines suffered &lt;unk&gt; killed between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; sent two companies from the &lt;unk&gt;st Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to pursue the retreating &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The Marines were ambushed by two &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies acting as rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by &lt;unk&gt;. By nightfall, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing &lt;unk&gt; Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On &lt;unk&gt; September, a patrol from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders encountered stragglers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed &lt;unk&gt; of them. As the &lt;unk&gt;apanese regrouped west of the &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their &lt;unk&gt; defenses. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; moved another battalion, the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;nd Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, an Allied naval convoy delivered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men from the &lt;unk&gt;rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. These reinforcements allowed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; beginning on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; to establish an unbroken line of defense around the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces &lt;unk&gt; next significant clashes with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese occurred along the &lt;unk&gt; River from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; October. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; September, General &lt;unk&gt; at Rabaul learned of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s defeat, the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army &lt;unk&gt;s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war. The general &lt;unk&gt; the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in &lt;unk&gt;apan. In an emergency session, the top &lt;unk&gt;apanese army and navy command staffs concluded that, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; might develop into the decisive battle of the war. &lt;unk&gt; The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on &lt;unk&gt;apanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. &lt;unk&gt; realized that, in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt;, he could no longer support the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese offensive on the &lt;unk&gt; Track in New Guinea. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; of the General Headquarters &lt;unk&gt; ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of their objective of Port Moresby &lt;unk&gt; to withdraw until the &lt;unk&gt; matter was resolved. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge contributed not only to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s defeat in the &lt;unk&gt; campaign, but also to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific. After delivering more forces during the next month the &lt;unk&gt;apanese mounted a major ground offensive on &lt;unk&gt;, led by &lt;unk&gt;, in late October &lt;unk&gt; at the Battle for Henderson Field, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. &lt;unk&gt; later stated that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, &lt;unk&gt; we would have been in a pretty bad condition. &lt;unk&gt; Historian Richard B. Frank adds, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September &lt;unk&gt;, on a ridge &lt;unk&gt; up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, during the American Revolutionary War. It took place near Charleston, South Carolina, during the first British attempt to capture the city from American rebels. It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston, owing to a more successful British siege in &lt;unk&gt;. The British organized an expedition in early &lt;unk&gt; for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America. &lt;unk&gt; by logistical concerns and bad weather, the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May &lt;unk&gt;. Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations, General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston. Arriving there in early &lt;unk&gt;une, troops were landed on Long Island, near Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island where Colonel William &lt;unk&gt; commanded a partially constructed fort, in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault. General Charles Lee, commanding the southern Continental theater of the war, would provide supervision. The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to &lt;unk&gt;, and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing. The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the &lt;unk&gt; nature of the fort &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; log construction. &lt;unk&gt; fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet, which withdrew after an entire day &lt;unk&gt;s bombardment. The British withdrew their expedition force to New York, and did not return to South Carolina until &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When the American Revolutionary War broke out in &lt;unk&gt;, the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America. The city &lt;unk&gt;s citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament &lt;unk&gt;s attempts to tax them, and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April &lt;unk&gt; Battles of Lexington and Concord. Throughout &lt;unk&gt; and into &lt;unk&gt;, militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, the city &lt;unk&gt;s manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel, and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British operations &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British army forces in North America were primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; bases of operations where they had more control, the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies. Major General Henry Clinton, then in Boston, was to travel to Cape Fear, North Carolina, where he would join with largely Scottish &lt;unk&gt; raised in the North Carolina &lt;unk&gt;, and a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men from Ireland under the command of Major General Charles Cornwallis. The plan was beset by difficulties from the start. The Irish expedition, originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December &lt;unk&gt;, was delayed by logistical difficulties, and its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops did not depart until February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, escorted by &lt;unk&gt; warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker. Clinton left Boston on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; with two companies of light infantry, and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon, New York &lt;unk&gt;s royal governor. Major General Charles Lee, sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York, &lt;unk&gt; arrived there the same day as Clinton. New York was at that time extremely tense ; &lt;unk&gt; forces were beginning to &lt;unk&gt; and evict &lt;unk&gt;, and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions. Despite this, Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south. Lee observed that this was &lt;unk&gt; certainly a &lt;unk&gt; way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited. &lt;unk&gt; This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South. Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March &lt;unk&gt;, expecting to find the European convoy already there. He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina, &lt;unk&gt;osiah Martin and William Campbell, and learned that the recruited Scottish &lt;unk&gt; had been defeated at Moore &lt;unk&gt;s Creek Bridge two weeks earlier. Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia, &lt;unk&gt;ames Wright, who had been arrested, and then escaped to a navy ship. Parker &lt;unk&gt;s fleet had an extremely difficult crossing. &lt;unk&gt; by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April &lt;unk&gt;, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May &lt;unk&gt;. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided &lt;unk&gt; properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on &lt;unk&gt; expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; American defenses &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt;, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina &lt;unk&gt;s revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Colonel William &lt;unk&gt;, a former &lt;unk&gt; and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and &lt;unk&gt;irginia ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops &lt;unk&gt;, as well as militia numbering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Charleston and the surrounding &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; saw Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, a sandy &lt;unk&gt; of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from &lt;unk&gt; enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged &lt;unk&gt; lying about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of &lt;unk&gt;ames Island, where Fort &lt;unk&gt;ohnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt;nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island in March &lt;unk&gt;, and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; naval detachment described the site as &lt;unk&gt; an immense pen &lt;unk&gt; feet long, and &lt;unk&gt; feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot &lt;unk&gt;. The gun platforms were made of &lt;unk&gt; two inches thick and &lt;unk&gt; with wooden spikes. Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; that the fleet had sailed, but that he did not know whether it was sailing for &lt;unk&gt;irginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt; confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy. &lt;unk&gt; He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city &lt;unk&gt;s defenses. He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments &lt;unk&gt; were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and &lt;unk&gt; had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces. Square &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall, with walls made from &lt;unk&gt; logs &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high and &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide. The walls were filled with sand, and rose &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted. A hastily erected palisade of thick &lt;unk&gt; helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls. An assortment of &lt;unk&gt; cannon, ranging from &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders to a few British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders and French &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders, dotted the front and rear walls. General Lee, when he had seen its unfinished state, had recommended abandoning the fort, calling it a &lt;unk&gt; slaughter pen &lt;unk&gt;. President &lt;unk&gt; refused, and specifically ordered Colonel &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; obey &lt;unk&gt; Lee &lt;unk&gt; in everything, except in leaving Fort Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; that he would replace &lt;unk&gt; ; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Point. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British arrival &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May &lt;unk&gt;, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. &lt;unk&gt; noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, just a few hundred yards from Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s. By &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five &lt;unk&gt; Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. &lt;unk&gt; believing he would not even need Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort &lt;unk&gt;s guns were knocked out, he would &lt;unk&gt; land &lt;unk&gt; and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose &lt;unk&gt; under the guns &lt;unk&gt; and that they could &lt;unk&gt; keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper &lt;unk&gt;. The British fleet was composed of nine man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war ships : the flagship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Bristol, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Experiment and frigates &lt;unk&gt;, Active, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly &lt;unk&gt; cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;rd, &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th, and &lt;unk&gt;th Regiments of Foot, and part of the &lt;unk&gt;th. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag &lt;unk&gt;, and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would &lt;unk&gt; across the channel ( now known as &lt;unk&gt; Inlet &lt;unk&gt; between Long and Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an &lt;unk&gt; of retreat for the fort &lt;unk&gt;s garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an &lt;unk&gt; at the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, which was manned by more than &lt;unk&gt; men and three small cannons, and began to &lt;unk&gt; a guard post at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. An attempt to &lt;unk&gt; the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely &lt;unk&gt; cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have &lt;unk&gt; the glory of being defeated alone. &lt;unk&gt; The attack was originally planned for &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On the morning of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel &lt;unk&gt;, commanding the &lt;unk&gt;nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the &lt;unk&gt;th South Carolina Artillery, numbering &lt;unk&gt; men. At around &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; am that morning, a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack. Less than an hour later, nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort. Thunder and Friendship anchored about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; from the fort while Parker took Active, Bristol, Experiment and &lt;unk&gt; to a closer position about &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; from Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, where they anchored facing broadside to the fort. Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position, and the defenders returned the fire. Although many of Thunder &lt;unk&gt;s shots landed in or near the fort, they had little effect ; according to &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; We had a &lt;unk&gt; in the middle, that swallowed them up instantly, and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort, were immediately buried &lt;unk&gt;. Thunder &lt;unk&gt;s role in the action was also relatively short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort, and the &lt;unk&gt; of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts. Owing to shortage of gunpowder, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire, and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons. They also fired in small &lt;unk&gt;, four cannon at a time. One British observer wrote, &lt;unk&gt; Their fire was surprisingly well served &lt;unk&gt; and it was &lt;unk&gt; slow, but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed. &lt;unk&gt; General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island. &lt;unk&gt; by two &lt;unk&gt; of war, the flotilla of &lt;unk&gt; carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson &lt;unk&gt;s defenses. Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt. Around noon the frigates &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; were sent on a roundabout route, avoiding some &lt;unk&gt;, to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort &lt;unk&gt;s main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort. However, all three ships grounded on an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; became entangled in the process. The British managed to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; remained grounded, having moved too far onto the submerged &lt;unk&gt;. Consequently, none of these ships reached its intended position, a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Had these three ships effected their purpose, they would have &lt;unk&gt; us in such a manner, as to have driven us from our guns. &lt;unk&gt; At the fort, &lt;unk&gt; ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort &lt;unk&gt;s guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his &lt;unk&gt;, leaving his &lt;unk&gt; exposed. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will go up to the town again. &lt;unk&gt; Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort &lt;unk&gt;s walls with persistent broadside &lt;unk&gt;. This strategy failed due to the &lt;unk&gt; nature of the &lt;unk&gt; wood used in its constructions ; the structure would &lt;unk&gt;, and it absorbed the &lt;unk&gt; rather than &lt;unk&gt;. The exchange continued until around &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range. At one point during the battle, the flag &lt;unk&gt; had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William &lt;unk&gt;asper reportedly ran to the &lt;unk&gt; and raised the flag again, holding it up and &lt;unk&gt; the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by &lt;unk&gt; with reviving the troops &lt;unk&gt; spirits, and later given &lt;unk&gt; for bravery. A painting of this event ( pictured above &lt;unk&gt; depicts &lt;unk&gt;asper &lt;unk&gt;s actions. &lt;unk&gt; casualties, Parker reported &lt;unk&gt; sailors killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than &lt;unk&gt; times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with &lt;unk&gt; sailors killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Active and &lt;unk&gt; reported &lt;unk&gt; casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded &lt;unk&gt; off the &lt;unk&gt;, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. &lt;unk&gt; in small boats sailed out to the burning ship, fired some of its cannons at the British ships, took what stores and &lt;unk&gt; they could, and retreated shortly before the ship &lt;unk&gt;s powder magazine exploded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, &lt;unk&gt; learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were &lt;unk&gt; on their transports, and on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by &lt;unk&gt; forces. The British did not return to Charleston until &lt;unk&gt;, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the South again became a focus of the war in late &lt;unk&gt;, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition &lt;unk&gt;s failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort &lt;unk&gt; shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William &lt;unk&gt; for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. &lt;unk&gt; modified in the years after the battle, it was &lt;unk&gt; by Fort &lt;unk&gt; as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In &lt;unk&gt;, to celebrate the centennial, companies from Savannah, Augusta, &lt;unk&gt;, Columbia, New York and Boston were invited to Charleston. The site was turned over to the National Park Service in &lt;unk&gt;, and is now part of Fort &lt;unk&gt; National Monument. A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island, overlooking the inlet where General Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers had hoped to cross. The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement. One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel &lt;unk&gt;. Commissioned by the colonial government, he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner, which was flown at the fort during the battle. Despite being shot down during the siege, it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory &lt;unk&gt;. It came to be known as the &lt;unk&gt; flag or Liberty Flag. When Charleston ( lost to the British in the &lt;unk&gt; siege &lt;unk&gt; was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war, the flag was returned to the city by General &lt;unk&gt; Greene.  &lt;unk&gt; High Five Interchange &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange is one of the first five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level stack interchanges built in Dallas, Texas. Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. &lt;unk&gt;ohnson Freeway ( Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Central Expressway ( &lt;unk&gt;S Highway &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, it replaces an &lt;unk&gt; partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the &lt;unk&gt;s. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million project was started in &lt;unk&gt; and completed in December &lt;unk&gt;. It was designed by the &lt;unk&gt; Corporation and built by &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation. The interchange is considered by Popular &lt;unk&gt; to be one of &lt;unk&gt; The World &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; because of its height ( as high as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story building &lt;unk&gt;, its &lt;unk&gt; permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features. In &lt;unk&gt;, the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as &lt;unk&gt; Public Works &lt;unk&gt; of the Year &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange, north of downtown in Dallas, Texas, is a massive five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level freeway interchange. It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic, the Lyndon B. &lt;unk&gt;ohnson Freeway ( Interstate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Central Expressway ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and is the first five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level stack interchange to be built in the city. It replaces the &lt;unk&gt; three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level, modified cloverleaf interchange built in the &lt;unk&gt;s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways. The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically, backing up traffic. Left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand exits contributed to the congestion. Further, its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other, making local access difficult. &lt;unk&gt; to the celebratory gesture, the &lt;unk&gt; High Five &lt;unk&gt; name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turn movements that tower over the landscape. The interchange is as high as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story building, and includes &lt;unk&gt; bridges spread across five levels ( the &lt;unk&gt; High Five &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; support tiers, and &lt;unk&gt; miles of additional highway. The highest ramps are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above ground. The lanes of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, which are on the bottom level, are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; below ground level, giving the structure a total height of &lt;unk&gt; feet from bottom to top As part of the project, I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was widened to include four dedicated high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; occupancy vehicle lanes ( &lt;unk&gt; lanes &lt;unk&gt; that are barrier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; separated and &lt;unk&gt;. The roads on the five levels are : Level I : &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, an eight lane highway, four lanes going each way Level II : The junction of the two six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane frontage roads, each having three through lanes in each direction, left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turn lanes and &lt;unk&gt;, and easy access to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Level III : I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, ten regular lanes, five going each way, and four &lt;unk&gt; lanes ( two going each way &lt;unk&gt; separated by barriers Level I&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; : Direct connection ramps ( two levels &lt;unk&gt;, eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf The interchange, with its decorative &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; concrete elements, along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, can be regarded as an enormous work of public art. The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail, named the &lt;unk&gt; Trail, which runs under all levels of the interchange. The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by &lt;unk&gt;. The interchange is considered by Popular &lt;unk&gt; as one of &lt;unk&gt; The World &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, calling it a &lt;unk&gt; labyrinth of lanes &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level &lt;unk&gt; of engineering &lt;unk&gt; because of its height, the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing, &lt;unk&gt; interchange that accommodated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas. It was a collaborative project between the &lt;unk&gt;, affected motorists and property owners, and the primary contractor, &lt;unk&gt; Construction. An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible. Reasons for upgrading the interchange, in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion, were to improve air quality, safety, and local access. &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million contract by &lt;unk&gt;, the largest ever by that agency. The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts. For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete &lt;unk&gt;s strength ( the first time &lt;unk&gt; had ever done so &lt;unk&gt;, and contained an early completion bonus, a &lt;unk&gt; scale of up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that &lt;unk&gt; was charged for &lt;unk&gt; lane rentals &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; for time they closed down traffic lanes &lt;unk&gt; fees based on &lt;unk&gt; assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to a high of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and &lt;unk&gt; so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed. Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished. To save time and money, innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; connect roads &lt;unk&gt; to be made of steel, but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction, cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans. However, &lt;unk&gt; decided to use &lt;unk&gt; concrete segmental bridges, rather than casting the bridge elements in place, and used a unique machine, designed and constructed by Deal &lt;unk&gt; of Italy and costing about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, to move the pieces into place. During the construction, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million cubic yards of &lt;unk&gt; was used, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square feet of retaining walls were built. Additionally, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet of drilled shafts and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; linear feet of drainage pipe were completed. In addition to the construction of &lt;unk&gt; permanent bridges, six temporary bridges were built, resulting in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million square feet of bridge deck. The project was designed by the &lt;unk&gt; Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction, which had begun in &lt;unk&gt; and was completed in December &lt;unk&gt;, more than &lt;unk&gt; months sooner than planned. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the American Public Works Association named the High Five &lt;unk&gt; Public Works Project of the Year &lt;unk&gt; for its massive size, its innovative design, the complexity and &lt;unk&gt; of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community. &lt;unk&gt; as the managing agency, &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation as the primary contractor, and &lt;unk&gt; Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; in Michigan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S Highway &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a component of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Highway System that connects Everett, Washington, to the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula ( &lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;S state of Michigan, with a separate segment that runs from &lt;unk&gt; Point, New York, to &lt;unk&gt;, Maine. In Michigan, the highway runs through the &lt;unk&gt;P in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system, entering the state at &lt;unk&gt; and ending at St. Ignace ; in between, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin. As one of the major transportation &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;P, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states. Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle &lt;unk&gt;, and other segments are listed as state &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; designated Pure Michigan &lt;unk&gt;. There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that date to the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;s. The highway runs through rural sections of the &lt;unk&gt;P, passing through two national and two state forests in the process. The route of what became &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the &lt;unk&gt;P, and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King &lt;unk&gt;s International Highway auto trails in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. The state later included these trails as part of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when the first state highway &lt;unk&gt; were designated in &lt;unk&gt;. Most of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was redesignated as part of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; when the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway System was created on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Since the &lt;unk&gt;s, several changes have &lt;unk&gt; the highway &lt;unk&gt;s routing through the &lt;unk&gt;P. One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley, Wisconsin, and others pushed an originally inland routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, part of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate &lt;unk&gt; ( I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, though in the &lt;unk&gt;s, the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; freeway, resulting in today &lt;unk&gt;s basic form. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to a &lt;unk&gt; regional planning committee report, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is a key highway for Michigan, providing its main western gateway. The roadway plays &lt;unk&gt; an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest &lt;unk&gt;, and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS &lt;unk&gt; for its entire length. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country &lt;unk&gt;s economy, defense, and mobility. Together with M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is part of a pair of primary &lt;unk&gt; that bridge the eastern and western sides of the &lt;unk&gt;P. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of roadway in Michigan is divided into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; western segment and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; eastern segment, interrupted by a section that runs for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; in the state of Wisconsin. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Western segment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley, Wisconsin, and &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into &lt;unk&gt; County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along &lt;unk&gt; Drive, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown &lt;unk&gt; and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues eastward through &lt;unk&gt;P woodlands to the city of &lt;unk&gt;. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake, meeting M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at a &lt;unk&gt; in town. As the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing &lt;unk&gt;ackson Creek and two branches of the &lt;unk&gt; Isle River. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the &lt;unk&gt; Isle in the community of &lt;unk&gt;. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in &lt;unk&gt; the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT &lt;unk&gt; recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of &lt;unk&gt; vehicles, compared to the overall average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns northerly to run along Lake &lt;unk&gt;. The highway continues parallel to the state line from the &lt;unk&gt; area through the national forest toward &lt;unk&gt;. That unincorporated community is the home of the &lt;unk&gt; High School &lt;unk&gt;, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the &lt;unk&gt; River, to Lake Michigan via the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the &lt;unk&gt; Wilderness, and the Lac &lt;unk&gt; Desert Indian &lt;unk&gt;, which includes the Lac &lt;unk&gt; Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from &lt;unk&gt; around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; intersects Federal Forest Highway &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; near Golden Lake in &lt;unk&gt; Township in the middle of the national forest. The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In town, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; intersects M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River, and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls, the county seat of Iron County. On the west side of town, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; meets &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue. The combined highway turns south onto &lt;unk&gt;th Street and meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s eastern terminus at the intersection between &lt;unk&gt;th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county &lt;unk&gt; at the top of the hill. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of, and parallel to, the &lt;unk&gt; River. The roadway passes Railroad, Kennedy and &lt;unk&gt; lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the &lt;unk&gt; River, crossing into Florence County, Wisconsin for about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Eastern segment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enters Michigan where it crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River and subsequently meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township north of Iron Mountain and &lt;unk&gt;. The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on &lt;unk&gt; Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine, parallel to a branch line of the &lt;unk&gt; and Lake Superior Railroad ( &lt;unk&gt; Railroad &lt;unk&gt;. The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the &lt;unk&gt; Mine. In downtown Iron Mountain at &lt;unk&gt; Street, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns west off &lt;unk&gt; Avenue to run across town to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the &lt;unk&gt; Mall. The highway re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enters &lt;unk&gt; Township where &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; separates to the south to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enter Wisconsin. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( &lt;unk&gt; Railway &lt;unk&gt;. Both road and rail travel through the community of &lt;unk&gt;, where they pass near the largest paper mill in the &lt;unk&gt;P. The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway, where the highway meets the eastern terminus of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. Then &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues east through rural Dickinson County to &lt;unk&gt;ulcan, passing north of &lt;unk&gt; Lake through the &lt;unk&gt; Country State Forest, before crossing the Sturgeon River in &lt;unk&gt; and passing into &lt;unk&gt; County. In &lt;unk&gt; County, the environment takes on a more agricultural character along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The highway passes through the edge of the community of &lt;unk&gt; before entering Powers. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; comes to a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way intersection and turns northeast merging onto &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and &lt;unk&gt; on the south side of the &lt;unk&gt; Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the &lt;unk&gt; Indian Community. Harris is on the &lt;unk&gt; County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to &lt;unk&gt; River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of &lt;unk&gt; River, the highway crosses the community &lt;unk&gt;s namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to four lanes along &lt;unk&gt; Street, which forms the east &lt;unk&gt; west axis of the &lt;unk&gt; street grid. Near downtown, the highway meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which runs along the city &lt;unk&gt;s north &lt;unk&gt; south axis, Lincoln Avenue. The &lt;unk&gt; merge and run north, bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor. Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula State &lt;unk&gt;, site of one of the two state &lt;unk&gt; for the state of Michigan, the only state to have twin &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de &lt;unk&gt; Community College. The four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane highway crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de &lt;unk&gt;. The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the state : an average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in &lt;unk&gt;. The road turns inland again, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; passes to the west of downtown Gladstone. The highway through here is an expressway, four lanes divided by a central median and no &lt;unk&gt; access. &lt;unk&gt;nlike a freeway, the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and crosses the &lt;unk&gt; Railroad south of the &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue North, where M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; separates from the &lt;unk&gt;S Highways and turns to the northwest. The expressway continues north parallel to the &lt;unk&gt; Railway, crossing the Days River. Through this area, the trunkline carries a speed limit of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; for car traffic. This is the only road in the &lt;unk&gt;P with a speed limit higher than &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; besides I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which has a speed limit of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de &lt;unk&gt; before ending at Rapid River. In this location, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; separates to the north, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; returns to an easterly track as a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane road, crossing the Rapid and &lt;unk&gt; rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay. As &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; crosses southern Delta County, it passes through the western unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest. Near Garden Corners, the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de &lt;unk&gt;. After the intersection with the northern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County. As the highway approaches Thompson, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; leaves the western unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest. The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to &lt;unk&gt;, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; River. The trunkline turns inland approaching &lt;unk&gt; and then turns north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northeast to Blaney Park. The community there is a former logging town &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turned &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; resort at the southern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the resort was active from the late &lt;unk&gt;s but declined by the &lt;unk&gt;s. From Blaney Park, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City. Where it intersects a former routing, the main highway crosses the &lt;unk&gt; Railway one last time and runs to the south of &lt;unk&gt; to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through &lt;unk&gt;. After passing the community of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; crosses the Cut River Bridge, &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; over the Cut River. The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest near &lt;unk&gt;, running between Lake Michigan and &lt;unk&gt; Lake in the process. The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline, passing &lt;unk&gt; Spot near &lt;unk&gt; Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace. The &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; designation ends at the highway &lt;unk&gt;s partial cloverleaf interchange with I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( BL I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Indian trail through auto trails &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; through the &lt;unk&gt;P were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between &lt;unk&gt; and Iron River were completed in late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula Development Bureau ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; named the area &lt;unk&gt; and the highway the &lt;unk&gt; Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to &lt;unk&gt;, and to all highways in the area in the early &lt;unk&gt;s ; the name was phased out by the &lt;unk&gt; completely in &lt;unk&gt;. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former &lt;unk&gt;S president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in &lt;unk&gt;. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the &lt;unk&gt;P, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle &lt;unk&gt; by seventy years, the route followed &lt;unk&gt; a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay... &lt;unk&gt; This route followed the modern &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt;, using the modern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to stay in Michigan. &lt;unk&gt; of the route followed &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between Powers and &lt;unk&gt;. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the &lt;unk&gt;P as well. In &lt;unk&gt;, the King &lt;unk&gt;s International Highway linked &lt;unk&gt;ancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. &lt;unk&gt; had to ship their cars by boat between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the &lt;unk&gt;nited States to continue along the auto trail. The &lt;unk&gt; varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; through the &lt;unk&gt;P from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in &lt;unk&gt; ; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Canada Highway name. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; State trunkline &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a designation that was in use by &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert &lt;unk&gt; near what is now &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; near Iron River in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Grand River Avenue &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; south of &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway System was created on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; partially replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Crystal Falls to &lt;unk&gt; became a new M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when the former M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; became &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( now &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which is now M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By the next year, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was added along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; as part of a larger extension. The first changes to the routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; itself were made in &lt;unk&gt; with a bypass of downtown &lt;unk&gt;. A larger &lt;unk&gt; was completed in &lt;unk&gt; between Rogers Park and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to &lt;unk&gt; and north to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie ; the former routing was given the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to a new bridge over the &lt;unk&gt; River between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Downtown &lt;unk&gt; was bypassed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the former route was initially designated M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD &lt;unk&gt; changed the &lt;unk&gt; and designations of the highways around &lt;unk&gt;, Thompson and &lt;unk&gt; in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s. The agency rerouted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was redesignated as an extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Thompson, and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was replaced by a further extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The last change was to route &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The MSHD started construction in &lt;unk&gt; on a new road that rerouted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into St. Ignace for the first time. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; previously followed Worth Road inland to the &lt;unk&gt; Trail to meet the northern extension of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula. The new routing took &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; along the &lt;unk&gt; into St. Ignace. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was routed through St. Ignace along the former &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Further changes in the early &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; the roadway out near &lt;unk&gt; and Crystal Falls. Additional &lt;unk&gt; were completed by the MSHD to move &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to its modern &lt;unk&gt; routing between Gould City and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to &lt;unk&gt; and then along the lake to &lt;unk&gt;. The former route through &lt;unk&gt; was turned back to local control as far east as &lt;unk&gt;. From there east, it was numbered just M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, removing &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from a concurrency. Another former section into &lt;unk&gt; was added to extend M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The new highway was &lt;unk&gt; around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in &lt;unk&gt; after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II. The western end of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; took on two changes in the &lt;unk&gt;s. M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was extended along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to the state line at &lt;unk&gt; from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension was made from M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s eastern terminus to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie in &lt;unk&gt;. The M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation was renumbered as Business &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. The eastern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; extension was reversed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interstate era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to a freeway between St. Ignace and &lt;unk&gt; St. Marie. In planning maps from &lt;unk&gt;, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the &lt;unk&gt;. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at &lt;unk&gt;rban Areas &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in &lt;unk&gt; as the federal government &lt;unk&gt; plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in &lt;unk&gt; was Interstate &lt;unk&gt; ( I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first section of freeway was built in late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; north of St. Ignace. The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to the bridge. In &lt;unk&gt;, another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sections. At the time, the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; on the bridge, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was shifted to follow I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; along the freeways in the St. Ignace area. The former routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. More sections of freeway were opened in &lt;unk&gt; immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie as well as between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The last two sections opened in &lt;unk&gt; connected the northern end of the freeway at M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, and the section between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. At this time, all of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Department of State Highways expanded &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in &lt;unk&gt;. The state built a new bridge over the &lt;unk&gt; River in &lt;unk&gt;, bypassing downtown. MDOT disposed of the former routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into downtown in two ways. The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control. An extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced the remainder, including the &lt;unk&gt; Bridge, through downtown. In that same year, the department truncated &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; freeway. The last changes were made to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s routing through Iron River in &lt;unk&gt;, bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town. In &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;, although the speed limit for trucks remains &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Memorial designations and tourist routes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the State Administrative Board named M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the predecessor to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Michigan, the &lt;unk&gt; Highway to honor Frank P. &lt;unk&gt;, a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the residents of &lt;unk&gt; created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane. The project consisted of &lt;unk&gt; and maple trees planted along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; west of town. The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; Women &lt;unk&gt;s Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, trees and shrubs as a &lt;unk&gt; parkway along &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;. Most of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, along with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the Lower Peninsula, was designated the &lt;unk&gt;nited Spanish War &lt;unk&gt;eterans Memorial Highway in &lt;unk&gt;. To connect the gap in the routing where &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; cuts through Wisconsin, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were used in place of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls. Signs marking the highway were not erected until &lt;unk&gt; when Governor George W. Romney had them installed. The &lt;unk&gt; Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between the northern &lt;unk&gt; city limits and County Road &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Delta County. The American &lt;unk&gt;eterans ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation, which was assigned under Public Act &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Two sections of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near &lt;unk&gt; to the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the segment from the southern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt; to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These two tours were created in May &lt;unk&gt; through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario. The section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail. This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the &lt;unk&gt; rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging. &lt;unk&gt; On August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT announced that the section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that runs concurrently with M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Delta County was being included in the &lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; Coast Recreational Heritage Trail. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Historic bridges &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are six bridges along current or former sections of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A third bridge added to the &lt;unk&gt; in late &lt;unk&gt; has not been added to MDOT &lt;unk&gt;s listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to &lt;unk&gt;, is a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. &lt;unk&gt;. The structure was listed on the &lt;unk&gt; on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the National Park Service approved the listing of the &lt;unk&gt;pper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; span, pin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; connected, &lt;unk&gt;, through &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( equivalent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the &lt;unk&gt;s, the &lt;unk&gt;pper Twin Falls Bridge carried &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; across the &lt;unk&gt; River. In &lt;unk&gt;, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September &lt;unk&gt;, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in &lt;unk&gt; Township, Dickinson County. As of October &lt;unk&gt;, even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced, MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list. It was built in &lt;unk&gt;. Before &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; used a different routing through &lt;unk&gt; and crossed the &lt;unk&gt; River on what is nicknamed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge &lt;unk&gt;. Built as a part of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the river, the water level is actually higher than the road surface. This produces a &lt;unk&gt; effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Paper Company was organized in &lt;unk&gt; and needed a dam on the &lt;unk&gt; River to supply their mill. This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded, and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction. Instead of expensive &lt;unk&gt;, a concrete tank was built &lt;unk&gt; in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made banks higher than the natural banks. The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having &lt;unk&gt; concrete bulkheads, formed by the side spans of the bridge, &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Tourism Council stated : &lt;unk&gt; At one time, the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was &lt;unk&gt; forced under it, &lt;unk&gt; and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley &lt;unk&gt;s Believe It or Not!. The eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; span structure is &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long. The Cut River Bridge carries &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; across the Cut River in &lt;unk&gt; Township, Mackinac County. This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; induced steel shortages. The span uses &lt;unk&gt; short tons ( &lt;unk&gt; long tons ; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; of structural steel to bridge the &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; over the river and its &lt;unk&gt; at a height of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above the river. The Cut River Bridge is one of only two &lt;unk&gt; deck &lt;unk&gt; bridges in the state. On either side of the bridge, there are picnic areas and trails down to the river. Listed on the &lt;unk&gt; on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Mackinac Trail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; River Bridge carries H &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the modern successor to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, over the &lt;unk&gt; River north of St. Ignace. The bridge is another &lt;unk&gt; arch structure &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in length and built in &lt;unk&gt;. Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to &lt;unk&gt; widen its deck by five feet &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; and install new &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; along with the addition of decorative retaining walls.

Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in &lt;unk&gt;. Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet, an annual convoy of East &lt;unk&gt; merchant ships from &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;ing Dynasty China to Britain, which was of vital economic importance to Britain. So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during &lt;unk&gt;, but had been called off following the Treaty of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore. To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at &lt;unk&gt; in the winter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the British commander in the East Indies, Rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Admiral Peter &lt;unk&gt;, sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS &lt;unk&gt; and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke. After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself. He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, which would make a valuable prize. &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox, Cooke reached the Spanish capital on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; in Manila Bay, Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive &lt;unk&gt; of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the &lt;unk&gt; River. &lt;unk&gt; the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting &lt;unk&gt; before returning to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San &lt;unk&gt;. The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in &lt;unk&gt;, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in &lt;unk&gt;, and the French presence in the region had been confined to &lt;unk&gt;le de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean. Some of the most important trade routes began at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;ing Dynasty China. Early in each year a large convoy known as the &lt;unk&gt; China Fleet &lt;unk&gt;, composed of large East &lt;unk&gt; merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company, sailed &lt;unk&gt; to Europe from &lt;unk&gt; laden with tea and other commercial cargo. This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in &lt;unk&gt; was valued at over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million ( the equivalent of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies, comprising six frigates commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pierre C&lt;unk&gt;sar Charles de &lt;unk&gt;. In the ensuing &lt;unk&gt; Strait Incident the commander deceived &lt;unk&gt; into believing that the &lt;unk&gt; convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated, only learning of his error on his return to &lt;unk&gt;le de France. There was considerable concern in India that &lt;unk&gt; might try again in &lt;unk&gt;, or that the Spanish, who maintained a powerful squadron at &lt;unk&gt;, might make an attempt of their own. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s initial impulse on learning in November &lt;unk&gt; of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines, centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in &lt;unk&gt;. Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operating with the Governor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; General of India Sir &lt;unk&gt;ohn Shore and Colonel Arthur &lt;unk&gt; among others, a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages, when unexpected news arrived in India in August &lt;unk&gt; announcing the Treaty of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end. Britain now faced France and Spain alone, while &lt;unk&gt; from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, an old opponent of Britain in Southern India, were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities. The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled, but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and &lt;unk&gt; diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China. A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of &lt;unk&gt; in preparation for the trip to &lt;unk&gt; to load trade goods and join the China Fleet. To escort this force, &lt;unk&gt; provided the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun frigate HMS &lt;unk&gt;, captured from the French at the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun HMS Centurion, which sailed with the convoy in &lt;unk&gt;uly, taking passage through the Straits of &lt;unk&gt;, joined there by the ships of the line HMS &lt;unk&gt; and HMS &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to &lt;unk&gt;. The convoy arrived without incident on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s raids &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reconnaissance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With his convoy safely at anchor in &lt;unk&gt; and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing, Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there. As an added motivation, rumours in &lt;unk&gt; suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive. This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila. &lt;unk&gt; its dollars in the Philippines, the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain. This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies, which operated at an enormous financial loss only &lt;unk&gt; by the substantial subsidy from New Spain. Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies, and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila &lt;unk&gt; since Thomas &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Leaving the heavier warships at &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke sailed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; only with &lt;unk&gt; and Fox, the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard, an experienced linguist. Passing Luzon, Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel, which was lured towards the frigates, which were flying French &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; the Spanish vessel, Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at &lt;unk&gt; and were unfit to sail. Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact, although he did remove &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; silver dollars. The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April &lt;unk&gt; and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s small squadron arrived off Manila. Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels, modelling &lt;unk&gt; on the powerful &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Forte and Fox on the smaller &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Late in the afternoon of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping &lt;unk&gt; past the fortress of &lt;unk&gt; and then sailing across the bay on the morning of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, anchoring between Manila and &lt;unk&gt;. From his &lt;unk&gt; point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in &lt;unk&gt;, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and &lt;unk&gt; and the frigates Maria de la &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon, &lt;unk&gt; being &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward &lt;unk&gt; was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack. Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage, and was consequently approached by the &lt;unk&gt;, whose crew came aboard. Malcolm, like Cooke, spoke French &lt;unk&gt; and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new &lt;unk&gt; were Forte and &lt;unk&gt; seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations. The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest. Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox, claiming to be Commodore &lt;unk&gt;, a French officer who, unknown to the Spanish, had been killed in the Action of &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; off Sumatra. The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the &lt;unk&gt;, which had been augmented by fake French uniforms. &lt;unk&gt; the visitor below decks, Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt; the downfall of England &lt;unk&gt;. For an hour the officers drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to &lt;unk&gt; the French &lt;unk&gt;. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at &lt;unk&gt;, Rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Admiral Don &lt;unk&gt; Mar&lt;unk&gt;a de &lt;unk&gt;, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at &lt;unk&gt; and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm &lt;unk&gt;s cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and &lt;unk&gt; their clothing. &lt;unk&gt; into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby &lt;unk&gt; River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed, one with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder long gun and two with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder long guns, each supplemented by four &lt;unk&gt; guns. The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards, furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned. Malcolm received him with a &lt;unk&gt; of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin, while the boat &lt;unk&gt;s crew were imprisoned below decks. Shortly afterwards, at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and &lt;unk&gt; to the crew, the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately &lt;unk&gt;. Once the meal was finished, Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole, although he retained the captured gunboats. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke led his small squadron past &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary and turned south. Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again, lost with its twelve crew. The frigates subsequently scouted &lt;unk&gt; before reaching &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary. There Cooke raised Spanish colours in an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but &lt;unk&gt; grounded on a &lt;unk&gt; at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a &lt;unk&gt; sent by the governor of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains, and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire, he put the town on alert. With the defenders &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke abandoned his &lt;unk&gt; and after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the following morning, ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour. This had little effect, though later the Spanish recovered at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from different &lt;unk&gt;, and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the &lt;unk&gt; side of the fort. The boats came under heavy fire, one smashed by a &lt;unk&gt;, killing two and wounding four. Another boat grounded on a &lt;unk&gt; and became stuck ; so with his force in &lt;unk&gt;, as &lt;unk&gt; villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the beach, Malcolm called off the operation. After exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range, with two dead and one wounded on &lt;unk&gt; and eight wounded on Fox, in addition to those lost in the boats. The defenders lost a single man killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. With his frigates now requiring repairs, Cooke withdraw half a league from &lt;unk&gt; and spent three days &lt;unk&gt; the masts and rigging of the ships. Then he sailed north, scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to &lt;unk&gt;. Four days later, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary the squadron halted at a village named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the north of the Sultanate of &lt;unk&gt; to collect fresh water. On the beach a boat party from &lt;unk&gt; was set upon by &lt;unk&gt; tribesmen. Two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive. Cooke complained to Sultan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the captured sailors were eventually recovered, although not before &lt;unk&gt; and Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat, although the mission had cost &lt;unk&gt; lives : Admiral &lt;unk&gt; later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty. More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C. &lt;unk&gt; Parkinson suggests that had Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at &lt;unk&gt;. He also notes however that in this scenario &lt;unk&gt; would have been commanding officer, a man with considerably less imagination and &lt;unk&gt; than Cooke. Historian Richard &lt;unk&gt; was critical of the mission, considering the operation to have &lt;unk&gt; no glorious outcome &lt;unk&gt; and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; coming. The &lt;unk&gt; China Fleet sailed without further incident. During the ensuing year Resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in &lt;unk&gt;uly in the &lt;unk&gt; Strait, and the majority of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea. This diversion of British resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and &lt;unk&gt; was able to send the frigate &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron. At the beginning of February &lt;unk&gt;, this combined force sailed to &lt;unk&gt;, taking the British defences by surprise. The British commander Captain William &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advancing on the Franco &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the &lt;unk&gt; Archipelago. The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion. The frigates Cooke had mimicked, Forte and &lt;unk&gt; were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was captured by HMS &lt;unk&gt; at the Action of &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; near Southern Africa, and Forte was intercepted by HMS &lt;unk&gt; under Cooke on &lt;unk&gt; February near &lt;unk&gt; in Bengal. In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded, dying on &lt;unk&gt; May.  &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death ( Slayer song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Reign in Blood. The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist, &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; led to the band facing accusations of Nazi &lt;unk&gt; and racism throughout their career. Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood, &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is featured on all of Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s live albums and D&lt;unk&gt;Ds and has appeared in several movies. The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a &lt;unk&gt; classic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Composition and origins &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Slayer guitarist &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman wrote &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; after reading books about Nazi physician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while on tour with the band : &lt;unk&gt; I remember stopping &lt;unk&gt; where I bought two books on &lt;unk&gt;. I thought, &lt;unk&gt; This has gotta be some sick shit. &lt;unk&gt; So when it came time to do the record, that stuff was still in my head &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt;s where the lyrics to &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; came from. &lt;unk&gt; The lyrics detail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins, and included both physical and psychological examinations. Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; are experimental &lt;unk&gt; performed without anesthesia, transfusion of blood between twins, isolation endurance, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with lethal &lt;unk&gt;, sex change operations, the removal of organs and limbs, and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; together, joining heads. &lt;unk&gt;ust a matter of time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; you rip &lt;unk&gt; apart &lt;unk&gt;, a line from the penultimate verse, is a reference to the allegation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; together twins, one of them deformed ; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to the other child, back to back, their wrists back to back too. &lt;unk&gt; This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor &lt;unk&gt; Alexander at the &lt;unk&gt; trial of SS &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Adolf &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; architect of the Holocaust &lt;unk&gt;, where it was asserted that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the veins together &lt;unk&gt; and turned &lt;unk&gt; them into &lt;unk&gt; twins. &lt;unk&gt; This allegation became more widely known when &lt;unk&gt; Alexander was featured in the &lt;unk&gt; documentary The Search for &lt;unk&gt;, which has been cited by several authors including Gerald &lt;unk&gt;, an expert on &lt;unk&gt;. Towards the end of the song, there is a line &lt;unk&gt; Feeding off the screams of the &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt;s creating &lt;unk&gt;, which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. &lt;unk&gt; was the villain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Controversy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The lyrical content of &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Reign in Blood. The band were signed to Def &lt;unk&gt;am Records whose distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns, deeming the artwork &lt;unk&gt; too graphic &lt;unk&gt;. Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule. &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust, as well as their families and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi &lt;unk&gt; which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman &lt;unk&gt;s interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; his most prized item being a German Knight &lt;unk&gt;s Cross. Hanneman &lt;unk&gt; asserting : &lt;unk&gt; I know why people &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s because they get this knee &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there &lt;unk&gt;s nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me &lt;unk&gt; well, isn &lt;unk&gt;t that obvious? I shouldn &lt;unk&gt;t have to tell you that. &lt;unk&gt; According to guitarist Kerry King : &lt;unk&gt; Yeah, &lt;unk&gt; Slayer are Nazis, fascists, communists &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; all that fun shit. And of course we got the most &lt;unk&gt; for it in Germany. I was always like, &lt;unk&gt; Read the lyrics and tell me what &lt;unk&gt;s offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s preaching fucking World War II? &lt;unk&gt; People get this thought in their heads &lt;unk&gt; especially in Europe &lt;unk&gt; and you &lt;unk&gt;ll never talk them out of it. &lt;unk&gt; The song drew accusations of racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews, and have stated numerous times that they do not &lt;unk&gt; racism and are merely interested in the subject. In &lt;unk&gt;, the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Christ Illusion drew comparison to &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; deals with the September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, attacks, and tells the story from a terrorist &lt;unk&gt;s perspective. &lt;unk&gt; Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;, although it did not &lt;unk&gt;, in part, he believes, due to peoples &lt;unk&gt; view that the song is &lt;unk&gt; just Slayer being Slayer &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music and structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is the longest track on the album Reign in Blood, spanning &lt;unk&gt; minutes and &lt;unk&gt; seconds, where the total duration of the album is &lt;unk&gt; minutes. Additionally, it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album, featuring prominent verses and choruses, where most tracks on the album &lt;unk&gt; them. Hanneman and King deliver their &lt;unk&gt; intricate riffs &lt;unk&gt;, which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand, and Araya bursts out his piercing scream, with Lombardo performing beats of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in &lt;unk&gt;, the band hired a full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; made one mistake out of the nine songs the band &lt;unk&gt; him with, on &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;. Before the &lt;unk&gt; big double bass part &lt;unk&gt; there is a lead section, which &lt;unk&gt; could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. &lt;unk&gt; could not tell how many &lt;unk&gt; the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members told him there were eight, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the song afterwards. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; did not enter any charts, it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blood. Clay &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; Magazine noted that the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; of any band playing fast and &lt;unk&gt; or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the &lt;unk&gt; to come, while musically laying the &lt;unk&gt; for the rest of the record : fast, lean and filthy. &lt;unk&gt; Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that &lt;unk&gt; There &lt;unk&gt;s no better song to kick things off than the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;, one of the most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist &lt;unk&gt; vocalist Tom Araya screams and &lt;unk&gt; his tale of Nazi war criminal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the publicity generated by the controversy, the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop &lt;unk&gt;, during the Seasons in the Abyss period. Hanneman placed SS &lt;unk&gt; on his guitar, and wrote &lt;unk&gt; SS &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a song about Reinhard &lt;unk&gt;, the second in command in the &lt;unk&gt; organization. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Appearances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; has appeared in several movies and T&lt;unk&gt; shows including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The New &lt;unk&gt; in a scene when the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is turning into a spider, &lt;unk&gt; : The Movie during a car stunt, the &lt;unk&gt; Iraq War documentary Soundtrack to War, which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield, and on an episode of The &lt;unk&gt; when &lt;unk&gt; asks a female escort to shoot her. The half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; She Watch Channel Zero?! &lt;unk&gt;, sampled by &lt;unk&gt; in their song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hell &lt;unk&gt;, which appeared in the Breaking Bad episode &lt;unk&gt; Thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Eight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and sampled by &lt;unk&gt; on their &lt;unk&gt; single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and featured in the multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; platform video game Tony Hawk &lt;unk&gt;s Project &lt;unk&gt;. Nolan Nelson, who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is &lt;unk&gt; one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded. Don &lt;unk&gt;t know who Slayer is? I feel sorry for you. &lt;unk&gt; A Slayer tribute band called Dead Skin Mask released an album with eight Slayer tracks, &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; being one of them.

It &lt;unk&gt; the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a &lt;unk&gt; street art documentary by graffiti artist &lt;unk&gt; who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Richard &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; Tonight The Streets Are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. &lt;unk&gt; Childs of The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club noted in his review of &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; that the &lt;unk&gt; reveal that the art show was a police &lt;unk&gt; gives the show a moment to joke about the anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. &lt;unk&gt; asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in &lt;unk&gt; ’ s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns. &lt;unk&gt; American street artist &lt;unk&gt; guest starred in &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; as himself. The graffiti art featuring Homer &lt;unk&gt;s face and the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Barack Obama &lt;unk&gt; Hope &lt;unk&gt; poster and his &lt;unk&gt; Giant image. &lt;unk&gt; has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early &lt;unk&gt;s because of its &lt;unk&gt; blend of humor and social commentary &lt;unk&gt;, and he felt &lt;unk&gt; deeply honored &lt;unk&gt; to be included in an episode. &lt;unk&gt; wrote on his website that &lt;unk&gt; Part of being on The Simpsons, is you ’ re being honored as a reference point in culture. &lt;unk&gt; He described the plot of the episode as &lt;unk&gt; great &lt;unk&gt;, adding that the staff members of the show &lt;unk&gt; were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed ( even though I had to make fun of myself to do so &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; This was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first acting performance. Street artists English, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; also guest starred in the episode as themselves. The traditional Simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that &lt;unk&gt; the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of &lt;unk&gt;. The Game of &lt;unk&gt; opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional map of the fictional continent &lt;unk&gt;. In the Simpsons opening, these locations were substituted with places in Springfield, and The Wall was replaced with the Simpson family &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The theme song featured in the Game of &lt;unk&gt; opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and used in the Simpsons opening as well. Nicholas &lt;unk&gt;, known for &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; covers of famous songs on YouTube, performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt;. He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It was watched by approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million people during this broadcast, and in the demographic for adults aged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the episode received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Nielsen rating and a seven percent share. This was a slight decrease from the previous episode, &lt;unk&gt; At Long Last Leave &lt;unk&gt;, which acquired a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating. The episode became the second highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated broadcast in Fox &lt;unk&gt;s Animation &lt;unk&gt; lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; demographic, finishing higher than new episodes of American Dad!, Napoleon &lt;unk&gt;, and The Cleveland Show, but lower than a new Family Guy episode ( which received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating and was seen by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million people &lt;unk&gt;.

Writing for The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club, television reviewer &lt;unk&gt; Childs commented that &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; somewhat amusing and far more coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode &lt;unk&gt; a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough. &lt;unk&gt; Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of &lt;unk&gt;. Tim &lt;unk&gt; of T&lt;unk&gt;.com called it &lt;unk&gt; one minute of genius &lt;unk&gt;, and MT&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Brandon &lt;unk&gt; wrote : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this one out of the park. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;enna Busch of &lt;unk&gt; and Kelly West of Cinema &lt;unk&gt;, both fans of Game of &lt;unk&gt;, named the opening the best in the history of the show. IGN &lt;unk&gt;s Eric Goldman commented : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever &lt;unk&gt; loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inspired version of the terrific Game of &lt;unk&gt; credits. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Burma &lt;unk&gt; The first &lt;unk&gt; invasions of Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were a series of military conflicts between &lt;unk&gt; Khan &lt;unk&gt;s Yuan dynasty, division of the &lt;unk&gt; Empire, and the Pagan Empire that took place between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The invasions toppled the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Pagan Empire, and the &lt;unk&gt; army seized Pagan territories in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and northern Burma to &lt;unk&gt;.

The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China. When King &lt;unk&gt; refused, Emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan himself sent another mission in &lt;unk&gt;, again demanding tribute. It too was rejected. In &lt;unk&gt;, the emperor ordered the &lt;unk&gt; government to secure the &lt;unk&gt; in order to block an escape path for the Song, and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested. Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the &lt;unk&gt; Army in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After a brief lull, &lt;unk&gt; Khan in &lt;unk&gt; turned his attention to Southeast Asia, demanding tribute from Pagan, the Khmer Empire, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt; king again refused, the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma. Two dry season campaigns ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; later, the Mongols had occupied down to &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, forcing the &lt;unk&gt; king to flee to Lower Burma. The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; negotiations began in &lt;unk&gt;, and ended with &lt;unk&gt; finally agreeing to submit in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the &lt;unk&gt; of the Yuan dynasty or the &lt;unk&gt; Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the &lt;unk&gt; government in exchange for the evacuation of &lt;unk&gt; troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as &lt;unk&gt; was assassinated in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The &lt;unk&gt; command at &lt;unk&gt; now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to &lt;unk&gt;. The Pagan Empire &lt;unk&gt; and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March &lt;unk&gt;, they accepted the voluntary submission of King &lt;unk&gt; of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. But &lt;unk&gt; was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in his &lt;unk&gt;, Il &lt;unk&gt;.

For much of its history, Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom and its predecessor &lt;unk&gt;, both with &lt;unk&gt; as their capital city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times &lt;unk&gt; themselves with the &lt;unk&gt; Empire to their west and at other times with China &lt;unk&gt;s Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered &lt;unk&gt; territory and Pagan were a wide &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; stretching from present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; prefectures in &lt;unk&gt; as well as the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; regions ( presumably in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day northern Shan State &lt;unk&gt;, which Pagan and &lt;unk&gt; had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the &lt;unk&gt; mostly consist of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of high mountain ranges. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; conquest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Empire first arrived at the &lt;unk&gt; of the Pagan Empire in &lt;unk&gt; by invading the &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The &lt;unk&gt; armies captured the capital, &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and went on to &lt;unk&gt; much of the kingdom by &lt;unk&gt;. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the &lt;unk&gt; as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in &lt;unk&gt; circuits of the former &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Decline of Pagan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calm, had been in long and slow decline since the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. The continuous growth of tax &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in South &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the decline continued. On the eve of the &lt;unk&gt; invasions, between one and two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; thirds of &lt;unk&gt;pper Burma &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; land had been donated to religion. The crown &lt;unk&gt;s ability to &lt;unk&gt; defenses was in serious jeopardy. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prelude to war &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; mission ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early &lt;unk&gt;. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s case, he had ordered the &lt;unk&gt; governor of &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; control of the &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; regions submitted to the Mongols. When the &lt;unk&gt; envoys led by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King &lt;unk&gt; to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the &lt;unk&gt; envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. &lt;unk&gt; them was a &lt;unk&gt; envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt;s wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious &lt;unk&gt; regions in April &lt;unk&gt;. The rebel leader A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was brought back to Pagan. &lt;unk&gt; relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second &lt;unk&gt; mission ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At Beijing, &lt;unk&gt; Khan, who was preparing an invasion of &lt;unk&gt;apan, decided against a war with Pagan &lt;unk&gt; for the time being. On &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, he sent a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; member delegation led by an imperial ambassador, the First Secretary to the Board &lt;unk&gt;, to Pagan. The delegation carried a letter from the emperor. The letter says : &lt;unk&gt; If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Highest, send one of your brothers or senior ministers, to show men that all the world is linked with &lt;unk&gt;s, and enter into a perpetual alliance. This will add to your reputation, and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war, who will be the victor? &lt;unk&gt; well, O king, Our words. &lt;unk&gt; This time, the &lt;unk&gt; king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. ( The &lt;unk&gt; chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed. But both &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed. &lt;unk&gt; At any rate, the imperial envoys did not get back to &lt;unk&gt; in due time. The newly formed &lt;unk&gt; government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; consolidation of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meanwhile, in &lt;unk&gt;, the former &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Din Omar as governor. In May &lt;unk&gt;, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the &lt;unk&gt; evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. &lt;unk&gt;ust coming off a disastrous &lt;unk&gt;apanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the &lt;unk&gt; provincial army to secure the &lt;unk&gt; in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the &lt;unk&gt; army proceeded to consolidate the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. ( Elsewhere, the main &lt;unk&gt; armies had captured most of the Song territory by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; By &lt;unk&gt;, at least one &lt;unk&gt; vassal state named &lt;unk&gt; Gold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( modern &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had submitted to the Mongols. Like in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in &lt;unk&gt;, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under &lt;unk&gt; command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking peoples or people from the further west : Turks from &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, but also captive soldiers from the Persian &lt;unk&gt; empire, the &lt;unk&gt;, and even &lt;unk&gt; from the lower &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Border war ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; What followed was a border war in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the &lt;unk&gt; of Marco Polo. Although the &lt;unk&gt; chronicles have no record of the border war, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inscription mentions the army &lt;unk&gt;s defeat at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo &lt;unk&gt;s accounts, a &lt;unk&gt; army &lt;unk&gt; invaded &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; territory of Gold &lt;unk&gt;, and was defeated by the &lt;unk&gt; army in April &lt;unk&gt;. The battle took place either at the &lt;unk&gt; valley ( in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; km southwest at &lt;unk&gt; ( present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture &lt;unk&gt;, which the &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt;. The Yuan Chronicle reports that only &lt;unk&gt; men defeated a &lt;unk&gt; army of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; horses and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It also reports only one &lt;unk&gt; was killed, in trying to catch an elephant. According to Marco Polo, the &lt;unk&gt; army consisted of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mounted &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on each of which was set a tower of timber, well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; framed and strong, and carrying from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed fighting men. &lt;unk&gt; Even then, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; figures of the &lt;unk&gt; army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the side of generosity &lt;unk&gt; not to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; their glory in defeating superior numbers. &lt;unk&gt; According to Marco Polo &lt;unk&gt;s account, in the early stages of the battle, the Turkish and &lt;unk&gt; horsemen &lt;unk&gt; took such &lt;unk&gt; at the sight of the &lt;unk&gt; that they would not be got to face the &lt;unk&gt;, but always &lt;unk&gt; and turned back, &lt;unk&gt; while the &lt;unk&gt; forces pressed on. But the &lt;unk&gt; commander &lt;unk&gt; did not panic ; he ordered his troops to &lt;unk&gt;, and from the cover of the nearby &lt;unk&gt;, aim their bows directly at the advancing &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Raid of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; army pressed on after the monsoon season. In the following dry season of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, c. December &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; army of &lt;unk&gt; led by &lt;unk&gt; al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Din, son of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advanced to &lt;unk&gt;, which defended the &lt;unk&gt; Pass. They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned &lt;unk&gt;. But they found the heat excessive and returned. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interlude ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Despite the &lt;unk&gt; military success, the control of the &lt;unk&gt; remained contested. Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions, and the &lt;unk&gt;, apparently taking advantage of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere, rebuilt their forts at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; later in &lt;unk&gt;, posting permanent garrisons commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. But their control was short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lived. The Great Khan &lt;unk&gt;s attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in &lt;unk&gt;. He had had mixed success : his &lt;unk&gt; forces had finished off the last of the Song in &lt;unk&gt; but had again failed to take &lt;unk&gt;apan in &lt;unk&gt;. That year, the &lt;unk&gt; emperor sent another mission to Pagan, demanding tribute yet again. The &lt;unk&gt; king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s court. ( With &lt;unk&gt;, the emperor summoned the king of &lt;unk&gt; himself to Beijing. &lt;unk&gt; At Pagan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit. The &lt;unk&gt; court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma. ( He also ordered an invasion of &lt;unk&gt;, whose king too had refused to submit. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt;s troubles did not go &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere in the kingdom. In the same year, a &lt;unk&gt; named &lt;unk&gt; seized the southern port city of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by killing its Pagan &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; appointed governor. Although the king &lt;unk&gt;s three sons were &lt;unk&gt; of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the king, preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north, did not ( or could not &lt;unk&gt; take any action on &lt;unk&gt;. Throughout &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of &lt;unk&gt; and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not &lt;unk&gt; an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men of the &lt;unk&gt; Persian &lt;unk&gt; Empire under the command of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was sent to &lt;unk&gt; to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central &lt;unk&gt;. On the &lt;unk&gt; side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; army led by generals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was deployed at a fort at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The invasion began on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Prince &lt;unk&gt; was the commander &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; chief of the invasion force ; his deputies were &lt;unk&gt;ice Governor &lt;unk&gt;, and commander &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the &lt;unk&gt; River using over &lt;unk&gt; boats ; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the &lt;unk&gt; fort at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; chronicles report an overwhelming number of &lt;unk&gt; forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. ( The chronicles say that the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men while the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; million men and &lt;unk&gt; million horses. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion of northern Burma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The defeat at &lt;unk&gt; broke the back of &lt;unk&gt; defenses. The &lt;unk&gt; army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. &lt;unk&gt;, the next fort &lt;unk&gt;, fell just six days later on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; sources say that the &lt;unk&gt; lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; armies pushed farther south into the &lt;unk&gt; valley. They took the ancient &lt;unk&gt; capital of &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; km north of Pagan on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing &lt;unk&gt; valley excessive, and evacuated &lt;unk&gt;, allowing the &lt;unk&gt; to return to &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;. But the &lt;unk&gt; army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook &lt;unk&gt;, and defeated another &lt;unk&gt; stand south of &lt;unk&gt;, probably near &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, opening the way to Pagan, about &lt;unk&gt; km south. After the defeat, the king &lt;unk&gt;, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The &lt;unk&gt; forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at &lt;unk&gt;, west of &lt;unk&gt;. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to &lt;unk&gt; but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was in open revolt. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Peace negotiations ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given his precarious position, &lt;unk&gt; decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols. In November &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the king ordered his generals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations. The &lt;unk&gt; commanders at &lt;unk&gt;, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; Wade &lt;unk&gt; Giles : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their &lt;unk&gt; demand that the &lt;unk&gt; king send a formal delegation to the emperor. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire, and central Burma to be organized as the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; Wade &lt;unk&gt; Giles : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Chung &lt;unk&gt;. After a long &lt;unk&gt;, the king agreed to submit but wanted the &lt;unk&gt; troops to withdraw. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, he sent an embassy led by Shin &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a learned monk, to the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s court. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Treaty of Beijing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the Yuan emperor. The &lt;unk&gt; delegation formally acknowledged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. ( Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal. &lt;unk&gt; In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops &lt;unk&gt; the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The &lt;unk&gt; embassy arrived back at &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, and reported the terms to the king. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; But the agreement broke down a month later. In late &lt;unk&gt;une, the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;iceroy of &lt;unk&gt;. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not &lt;unk&gt; broke away. No successor to &lt;unk&gt;, who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing, emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intervention ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given the chaos, the governor of &lt;unk&gt; ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The &lt;unk&gt; army commanded by Prince &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sin &lt;unk&gt;, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era &lt;unk&gt; scholarship, the &lt;unk&gt; army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of &lt;unk&gt; men ; occupied the city ; and sent out &lt;unk&gt; to receive homage, one of which reached south of &lt;unk&gt;. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary &lt;unk&gt; of the conquest. Recent research shows that the &lt;unk&gt; forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the &lt;unk&gt; defenses led by commanders &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and probably never got closer than &lt;unk&gt; km north of Pagan. ( An inscription dated &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the &lt;unk&gt; army. &lt;unk&gt; Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the &lt;unk&gt; army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to &lt;unk&gt;. They remained there as the treaty was now void. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete. But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created. They would send no more expeditions to restore order. The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to &lt;unk&gt; the fragmented country. Indeed, his real aim all along may have been &lt;unk&gt; to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented. &lt;unk&gt; It would be another two years until one of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sons, &lt;unk&gt;, emerged as king of Pagan in May &lt;unk&gt;. But the new &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt; controlled just a small area around the capital, and had no real army. The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers. The uneasy arrangement would persist until &lt;unk&gt;. The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to &lt;unk&gt; as the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but ended the fictional central Burma province of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers &lt;unk&gt; consolidating support. To check their rising power, &lt;unk&gt; submitted to the Mongols in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and was recognized by the Yuan emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan as King of Pagan on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of &lt;unk&gt;. The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power. On &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the three brothers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and founded the &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom. The &lt;unk&gt; forced the &lt;unk&gt; government to intervene again, leading to the second &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The invasion failed. Two years later, on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt;, the Mongols abolished the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, evacuated &lt;unk&gt;, and returned to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The war was one of several near simultaneous wars &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt; Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late &lt;unk&gt;th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols, the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions &lt;unk&gt; in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Age of political fragmentation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire. However, the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it. Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s disintegration was &lt;unk&gt; in fact more prolonged and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government, the collapse could have been temporary, and the country “ could have risen again ”. But the dynasty could not recover, and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum, no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath. As a result, several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. It was only in the late &lt;unk&gt;th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the &lt;unk&gt; basin, restoring some semblance of normalcy. The vast region surrounding the &lt;unk&gt; valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states well into the &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rise of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the &lt;unk&gt; invasions was the emergence of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia. The Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan people who came down with the &lt;unk&gt; invasions stayed. By the early &lt;unk&gt;th century, several Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt; to northern and eastern &lt;unk&gt; to northern and central Thailand and Laos. Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols, who viewed the states as a useful &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and the rest of Southeast Asia. The Mongols, who were still trying to incorporate &lt;unk&gt; into the central administration, were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of &lt;unk&gt; into the fold. ( The integration of &lt;unk&gt; itself into “ China &lt;unk&gt; ” was to take several more centuries, and continues to today. &lt;unk&gt; As such, from the newly formed Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai &lt;unk&gt;iet and &lt;unk&gt; in eastern Southeast Asia, the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute. Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government, they were the native chieftains, “ who would have ruled there in any case, and they did as they pleased. ” &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of China on the &lt;unk&gt; border &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The war also marked the arrival of China at the &lt;unk&gt; of Burma. The old &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom, known to the &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; Raj &lt;unk&gt; was now a &lt;unk&gt; Chinese province. ( The &lt;unk&gt; now called the new powers at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking soldiers of &lt;unk&gt;. Over the years, the term &lt;unk&gt; came to be used to refer to the Han Chinese. Today, King &lt;unk&gt; is remembered as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, ( &lt;unk&gt; the King who fled from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chinese &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; From a &lt;unk&gt; standpoint, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chinese presence in &lt;unk&gt; pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma ( and parts of the Khmer Empire &lt;unk&gt;. The raids by various Shan states into &lt;unk&gt;pper Burma would continue until the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mongolia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; relations &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the official visit by the President &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; in November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; San Suu &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; of National League for Democracy, said this was the first ever &lt;unk&gt; mission since the Mongols came &lt;unk&gt; years earlier.  &lt;unk&gt; The Boat Race &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Boat Race took place on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. Held annually, the event is a side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side rowing race between crews from the &lt;unk&gt;niversities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Oxford won the race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s crew featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history. The race took place in very difficult weather conditions &lt;unk&gt; strong winds and heavy rain &lt;unk&gt; resulting in the slowest winning time in over sixty years. Oxford won by six lengths, the largest margin of victory since the &lt;unk&gt; race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis beat Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie in the reserve race, while Oxford won the Women &lt;unk&gt;s Boat Race. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Boat Race is a side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side rowing competition between the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; Dark Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; Light Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. First held in &lt;unk&gt;, the race takes place on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Oxford by over a length in the previous year &lt;unk&gt;s race and the overall lead, with &lt;unk&gt; victories to Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The race was sponsored by &lt;unk&gt; for the fourth time. The first Women &lt;unk&gt;s Boat Race took place in &lt;unk&gt;, but did not become an annual fixture until the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt;ntil &lt;unk&gt;, the contest was conducted as part of the &lt;unk&gt; Boat Races, but as of the &lt;unk&gt; race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men &lt;unk&gt;s main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis boat and Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie boat has been held since &lt;unk&gt;. It usually takes place on the &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the main Boat Race. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Crews &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s crew weighed an average of &lt;unk&gt; pounds ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; more per rower than their opponents, and featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old American Mike &lt;unk&gt;. Cambridge crew consisted of six Britons, two Australians and an American, while Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s comprised four Americans, three Britons, an Australian and a German. Both &lt;unk&gt;, Nick &lt;unk&gt; and Rebecca &lt;unk&gt;, were former Blues, while Cambridge also saw &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Tom Edwards return, having rowed in &lt;unk&gt;. Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s boat club president Dan O &lt;unk&gt; was the seventh Light Blue president not to row in his own Blue Boat. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford were pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; race favourites, but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. Oxford took an early lead, but the boats closed on each other, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both &lt;unk&gt; in an attempt to prevent a collision. By &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded ; by the time the crews passed under &lt;unk&gt; Bridge they were level. Along &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford moved ahead once again, and were clear of Cambridge after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in &lt;unk&gt; minutes &lt;unk&gt; seconds, six lengths and &lt;unk&gt; seconds ahead of their opponents. Driving rain, strong winds and &lt;unk&gt; water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years, but the largest margin of victory since the &lt;unk&gt; race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis beat Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie by three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter lengths in the reserve race. Oxford won the &lt;unk&gt;th running of the Women &lt;unk&gt;s Boat Race by half a length. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Oliver Moore said &lt;unk&gt; we got the rage going in the crew, and we started to kill it, we hit an awesome rhythm &lt;unk&gt;. Cambridge coach Duncan Holland &lt;unk&gt; his opponents : &lt;unk&gt; Well done to Oxford, they were much faster on the day &lt;unk&gt;. Following tradition, the victorious Oxford crew tossed their &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; into the Thames.  &lt;unk&gt; Training Day ( The Office &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; is the twentieth episode of the seventh season of the American comedy television series The Office and the shows &lt;unk&gt; episode overall. It originally aired on NBC on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode was written by Daniel Chun and directed by Paul &lt;unk&gt;. This episode marks the first appearance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ickers ( Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the series. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott &lt;unk&gt;s ( Steve Carell &lt;unk&gt; replacement appears in the office, to start receiving training from Michael. The new manager, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ickers ( Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, has everyone hoping to make good first impressions : Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms &lt;unk&gt; finds himself &lt;unk&gt; typecast while &lt;unk&gt;im Halpert ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Krasinski &lt;unk&gt; and Pam Halpert ( &lt;unk&gt;enna Fischer &lt;unk&gt; worry that they &lt;unk&gt;ve come on too strong. Only Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; about the new leader. &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from television critics, with many commenting on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s appearance. The episode was also viewed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers and received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent rating among adults between the ages of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, ranking first in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated NBC series of the night. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Synopsis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michael is waiting in a hotel bar for his replacement &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ickers ( Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to show up. While waiting, he meets a man at the bar and the two instantly hit it off. When Michael calls &lt;unk&gt;ickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually &lt;unk&gt;, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this. &lt;unk&gt; comes to the branch the next day, and most of the staff is eager to make a good first impression. Kevin wears his &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam believe they have started off well by mentioning their baby, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Andy as the office &lt;unk&gt; funny guy &lt;unk&gt; when he reveals that he carries name &lt;unk&gt; around to avoid situations like the one &lt;unk&gt; and Michael were in. Meanwhile, Dwight is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when &lt;unk&gt; wants to make some changes, such as how Erin answers the phone. While &lt;unk&gt; gets annoyed with &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he &lt;unk&gt; hot coffee on his pants and ( at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s urging &lt;unk&gt; eats soap ; Andy tells the camera with &lt;unk&gt; sadness that &lt;unk&gt; this is my life now &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out &lt;unk&gt; butter sandwiches, despite &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; allergy. &lt;unk&gt; then &lt;unk&gt; the staff in the &lt;unk&gt; multipurpose room &lt;unk&gt;, including Dwight, who learned from &lt;unk&gt; that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus &lt;unk&gt; Michael. &lt;unk&gt;im quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. &lt;unk&gt; then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he &lt;unk&gt;s a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won &lt;unk&gt;t be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while &lt;unk&gt; conducts his meeting in the conference room. In another effort to impress &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam bring in &lt;unk&gt;, to which &lt;unk&gt; reacts positively. While they celebrate getting back on his good side, &lt;unk&gt; reveals to the camera that he is in fact indifferent to &lt;unk&gt; and was just being polite. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The episode was written by co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; executive producer Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; showrunner Paul &lt;unk&gt;, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; episode arc on the series and is also one of series star, Carell &lt;unk&gt;s last episodes as a regular on the series. &lt;unk&gt; signed on to appear in Steve Carell &lt;unk&gt;s final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, &lt;unk&gt; The Inner Circle &lt;unk&gt;, to make Carell &lt;unk&gt;s transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because &lt;unk&gt; I just think it &lt;unk&gt;s time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I just thought it was time for my character to go &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell &lt;unk&gt;s last season, because he &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell ’ s swan song &lt;unk&gt;. He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the &lt;unk&gt; film, &lt;unk&gt; : The Legend of Ron &lt;unk&gt;. The Season Seven D&lt;unk&gt;D contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include a sequence in which Michael and &lt;unk&gt; discuss cancer jokes and the &lt;unk&gt; film Megamind &lt;unk&gt; an animated film that featured the voice of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while drinking &lt;unk&gt;, shots of Michael and &lt;unk&gt; discussing their enjoyment for coffee, and Dwight attempting to appease his new boss. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ratings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In its original American broadcast, &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; was viewed by an estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers and received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; share among adults between the ages of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. This means that it was seen by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of all &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of all &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sale &lt;unk&gt;, which can be attributed to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s guest appearance. The episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating the Fox crime drama &lt;unk&gt;, which scored a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent relating in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; demographic ; a &lt;unk&gt; of the ABC medical drama Grey &lt;unk&gt;s Anatomy and a &lt;unk&gt; of the CBS crime drama &lt;unk&gt; : Crime Scene Investigation. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reviews &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from television critics. IGN writer &lt;unk&gt; White wrote that &lt;unk&gt; was not given a proper introduction and that he wasn &lt;unk&gt;t distinguished from Michael &lt;unk&gt;s character. She also went on to criticize &lt;unk&gt;im, Pam and Dwight &lt;unk&gt;s reaction to &lt;unk&gt; as the new manager, particular that of &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam, writing that &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s becoming &lt;unk&gt; obvious that the longtime writers don &lt;unk&gt;t know what to do with them anymore &lt;unk&gt;. However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season &lt;unk&gt;s improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; rating, denoting a &lt;unk&gt; good &lt;unk&gt; episode. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club reviewer Myles &lt;unk&gt; praised Michael &lt;unk&gt;s reactions to the office easily ignoring him for &lt;unk&gt;, calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone &lt;unk&gt; quite effective &lt;unk&gt;, and that Dwight &lt;unk&gt;s reaction to not being suggested to be Michael &lt;unk&gt;s replacement made it more &lt;unk&gt; meaningful &lt;unk&gt;. Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not &lt;unk&gt; sophisticated &lt;unk&gt; enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look &lt;unk&gt; stupid &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; cheap humor &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; enormously shallow laughter &lt;unk&gt;. He ultimately gave the episode a &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between &lt;unk&gt; and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael &lt;unk&gt; being &lt;unk&gt; about not being the center of attention every minute of every day &lt;unk&gt;, negatively comparing it to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Party &lt;unk&gt;. Despite this, he noted that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s presence did involve several funny moments. Bonnie &lt;unk&gt;, for Paste, was more positive, writing that she preferred the use of comedy, following the emotional episode, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sale &lt;unk&gt;. She ultimately gave it an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was especially noted by critics. &lt;unk&gt; complimented &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performance, but called his character &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; praised his dynamic with Carell, comparing it to their previous roles in &lt;unk&gt;. His later appearances in the series also received similar mixed reviews For instance, &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s scenes a &lt;unk&gt; momentum killer &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Michael &lt;unk&gt;, whereas Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called his performance in the same episode &lt;unk&gt; pure magic &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is a song by Irish rock band &lt;unk&gt;. It is the opening track from their &lt;unk&gt; album The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree and was released as the album &lt;unk&gt;s third single in August &lt;unk&gt;. The song &lt;unk&gt;s hook is a repeating guitar &lt;unk&gt; using a delay effect, played during the song &lt;unk&gt;s introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person &lt;unk&gt;s religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band &lt;unk&gt;s difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt;s tapes to have them start from scratch. &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the &lt;unk&gt;S, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in &lt;unk&gt; on The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. The song was performed on a Los Angeles &lt;unk&gt; for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music &lt;unk&gt;ideo. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Writing and recording &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The music for &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at &lt;unk&gt; House &lt;unk&gt; his newly purchased home &lt;unk&gt; The Edge used a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. &lt;unk&gt; that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, The Edge wanted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up the ultimate &lt;unk&gt; live &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt;, so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future &lt;unk&gt; show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with &lt;unk&gt; the most amazing guitar part and song of &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; life &lt;unk&gt;. With no one in the house to share the demo with, The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration. Although the band liked the demo, it was difficult for them to record the song. &lt;unk&gt; Adam Clayton said, &lt;unk&gt; At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works &lt;unk&gt;. The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was &lt;unk&gt; many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; producer Daniel Lanois, &lt;unk&gt; that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse &lt;unk&gt;, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking &lt;unk&gt;. It was ridiculous. &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance. So much time had been spent on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt; that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch. His idea was to &lt;unk&gt; stage an accident &lt;unk&gt; and have the song &lt;unk&gt;s tapes erased. He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes &lt;unk&gt; up and ready to be recorded over, but this &lt;unk&gt; never took place ; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the &lt;unk&gt; of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno. The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve &lt;unk&gt; in the final months of recording The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, &lt;unk&gt;r. later said of the song, &lt;unk&gt; It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it &lt;unk&gt;s not half the song it is live. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is played at a tempo of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. The introduction and &lt;unk&gt; are played in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; time signature, while the remainder of the song is in a common &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; signature. The songs opens with an instrumental section, starting with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like sustained &lt;unk&gt; notes. The guitar fades in after &lt;unk&gt; seconds ; this part consists of a repeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; note &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; dotted eighth &lt;unk&gt; delay effect is used to &lt;unk&gt; play &lt;unk&gt; each note in the &lt;unk&gt; twice, thus creating a rich sound. The bass and drums enter at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The introduction, following a I &lt;unk&gt; I&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt; I&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I chord progression, creates a &lt;unk&gt; wall of sound &lt;unk&gt;, as described by Mark Butler, against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes. The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming &lt;unk&gt; sixteenth notes. The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes, respectively, while Bono &lt;unk&gt;s vocal performance, in contrast, varies greatly in its &lt;unk&gt;, ( &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; he allows his voice to crack &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as well as timing by his usage of &lt;unk&gt; to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat. This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line &lt;unk&gt; burning down love &lt;unk&gt; ( A &lt;unk&gt; G &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song, the &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; burning &lt;unk&gt;. In later choruses, Bono sings &lt;unk&gt; blown by the wind &lt;unk&gt; with the same melody, stretching the same note even longer. After the third chorus, the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; is played, the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction, with a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; note guitar &lt;unk&gt; played against sustained &lt;unk&gt; notes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lyrics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast, Northern Ireland, where a person &lt;unk&gt;s religion and income are evident by the street they live on. He contrasted this with the &lt;unk&gt; he felt when visiting Ethiopia, saying : &lt;unk&gt;... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren &lt;unk&gt;t such divisions, a place where the streets have no name. To me, that &lt;unk&gt;s the way a great rock &lt;unk&gt; n &lt;unk&gt; roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together... Maybe that &lt;unk&gt;s the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all. &lt;unk&gt; Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an &lt;unk&gt; bag while staying in a village. According to him, the song is ostensibly about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, elevation, whatever you want to call it. &lt;unk&gt; Bono, who compared many of his lyrics prior to The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree to &lt;unk&gt; sketches &lt;unk&gt;, said that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is more like the &lt;unk&gt; of old than any of the other songs on the LP, because it &lt;unk&gt;s a sketch &lt;unk&gt; I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location. I was trying to sketch a feeling. &lt;unk&gt; The open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations. &lt;unk&gt;ournalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send &lt;unk&gt; a message of hope &lt;unk&gt; and wish for a &lt;unk&gt; world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion &lt;unk&gt;. With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;m not sure, really, about that. I used to think it was Belfast... &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono &lt;unk&gt;s and his wife Ali &lt;unk&gt;s visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ended lyrics : &lt;unk&gt; I can look at it now and recognize that &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt; has one of the most &lt;unk&gt; couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don &lt;unk&gt;t communicate. But if you &lt;unk&gt;re flip or &lt;unk&gt; about it, then you do. That &lt;unk&gt;s one of the &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve come to terms with. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Originally, the third single from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree was meant to be the song &lt;unk&gt; Red Hill &lt;unk&gt; Town &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was released instead, in August &lt;unk&gt;. The single was released on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, cassette and CD single formats. Three B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides were featured on the single, including &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Thing &lt;unk&gt;, except for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch release, which only featured the latter two tracks. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch single featured &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt; on side A of the record ( despite being a &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape. Although not as successful as the album &lt;unk&gt;s first two singles, the song did chart well. In the &lt;unk&gt;.S., the song peaked at number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt; and number &lt;unk&gt; on the Album Rock Tracks charts. The song reached number four on the &lt;unk&gt;K Singles Chart, and it topped the Irish Singles Chart. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music video &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles, and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc &lt;unk&gt; stating that &lt;unk&gt; is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people. Police show up to the set and inform the band &lt;unk&gt;s crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing, due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance. Two minutes into the video, &lt;unk&gt; are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; and S. Main St., and perform &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are &lt;unk&gt; the police. The video for &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was directed by &lt;unk&gt; Avis and produced by Michael &lt;unk&gt; and Ben &lt;unk&gt;. The band attracted over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people during the video &lt;unk&gt;s filming, which took place on the &lt;unk&gt; of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The band &lt;unk&gt;s performance on a &lt;unk&gt; in a public place was a reference to The Beatles &lt;unk&gt; final concert, as depicted in the film Let It Be. During the shoot &lt;unk&gt; played an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; song set, which included four performances of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be &lt;unk&gt; by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. &lt;unk&gt; was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day &lt;unk&gt; almost in real time &lt;unk&gt;, and that &lt;unk&gt; getting &lt;unk&gt; was an integral part of the plan. &lt;unk&gt; Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in &lt;unk&gt; that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to &lt;unk&gt; the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded version of the song. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music &lt;unk&gt;ideo at the &lt;unk&gt; Grammy Awards. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt; was released on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. The song developed from the band &lt;unk&gt;s interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as &lt;unk&gt; a kind of Afro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rhythmic piece &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; a study in rhythm. &lt;unk&gt; The bass riff in the song, inspired by the &lt;unk&gt;, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton &lt;unk&gt;s unused bass parts. Mullen &lt;unk&gt;s drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono &lt;unk&gt;s trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase &lt;unk&gt; Race against time &lt;unk&gt;. Bono said of the song, &lt;unk&gt; It reminds me of the desert. The desert is so empty, but it &lt;unk&gt; with a strange kind of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an &lt;unk&gt; African flavour &lt;unk&gt; and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel. The track was used in the Miami &lt;unk&gt;ice episode &lt;unk&gt; Child &lt;unk&gt;s Play &lt;unk&gt;, and is the only one of the single &lt;unk&gt;s B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides that was never played live. &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt; was written in support of the Artists &lt;unk&gt;nited Against &lt;unk&gt; project, which protested the South African apartheid. In &lt;unk&gt;, Bono participated in Steven &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick &lt;unk&gt;agger of The Rolling Stones. When Richards and &lt;unk&gt;agger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre, as most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s. Bono realised that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had no tradition &lt;unk&gt;, and he felt as if they &lt;unk&gt; were from outer space &lt;unk&gt;. This inspired him to write the blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; influenced song &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt;, which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded by &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; single while the band returned to Dublin during in May &lt;unk&gt; during a break between the first and second legs of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. The song was described by Musician as &lt;unk&gt; tough and raw, with Bono in &lt;unk&gt; and confident voice, &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt; bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based guitar. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt; was played live on The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album and &lt;unk&gt;, Rattle and Hum. Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary edition of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. The studio version was also included on the limited edition B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides bonus disk of the band &lt;unk&gt;s first compilation album, The Best of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Thing &lt;unk&gt; was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday. The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play. Some of Bono &lt;unk&gt;s lyrics have been described as reminiscent of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon. The Edge described it as &lt;unk&gt; a beautiful song... which is pop as it should be &lt;unk&gt; not produced out of existence, but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity &lt;unk&gt;, also noting that &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s very new for us. &lt;unk&gt; It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in &lt;unk&gt; as a single in its own right for The Best of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track, along with &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt;, is &lt;unk&gt; an indicator of what &lt;unk&gt; might have made instead of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;pon the release of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, critics praised &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. Steve &lt;unk&gt; of The Boston Globe noted the &lt;unk&gt; bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like tones from the Edge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; e &lt;unk&gt; a search for heaven &lt;unk&gt; and along with the subsequent track on the album, &lt;unk&gt; I Still Haven &lt;unk&gt;t Found What I &lt;unk&gt;m Looking For &lt;unk&gt;, these songs showed how the group were &lt;unk&gt; pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers &lt;unk&gt;. The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments, saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest. Rolling Stone called it &lt;unk&gt; assertive rock &lt;unk&gt; in their review of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. The San Diego &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Tribune said of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the music charges, like someone fleeing for life &lt;unk&gt;. The Washington Post said the track is &lt;unk&gt; a bit oblique lyrically, but the implications are clear in Bono &lt;unk&gt;s resolute delivery, Dave ( the Edge &lt;unk&gt; Evan &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; guitar, Adam Clayton &lt;unk&gt;s cathedral bass and Larry Mullen &lt;unk&gt;s rolling thunder drums &lt;unk&gt;. NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album &lt;unk&gt; starts by spitting furiously &lt;unk&gt;. The publication praised Bono &lt;unk&gt;s impassioned singing and The Edge &lt;unk&gt;s guitar playing, which transformed the instrument into &lt;unk&gt; something more than an &lt;unk&gt; abused piece of wood &lt;unk&gt;. The review commented that the &lt;unk&gt; last ten seconds are &lt;unk&gt; beautiful &lt;unk&gt;. The Rocket wrote that the song builds a &lt;unk&gt; wall of sound &lt;unk&gt; that Bono &lt;unk&gt;s vocals cut through with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, as the lyrics &lt;unk&gt; the need for personal spirituality &lt;unk&gt;. The reviewer compared the opening riff to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Reviewing The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an &lt;unk&gt; epic opener &lt;unk&gt;. The service &lt;unk&gt;s Steve Huey, in a review of the song, praised its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, propulsive rhythmic drive and &lt;unk&gt; chorus &lt;unk&gt;, qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite. He called the song the &lt;unk&gt; perfect album &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; opener &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak &lt;unk&gt;. Huey also called Bono &lt;unk&gt;s delivery &lt;unk&gt; passionate and grandiose &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; his commitment to the material &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He believed the combination of his vocals and the band &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; sonic power &lt;unk&gt; is what gave &lt;unk&gt; its &lt;unk&gt; tremendous force &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; made its concert debut on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Arizona on the opening night of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. It has since been played at nearly every full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; length concert that &lt;unk&gt; has &lt;unk&gt;, totaling over &lt;unk&gt; performances as of &lt;unk&gt;. The song is widely regarded as one of the group &lt;unk&gt;s most popular live songs. Bono said of it, &lt;unk&gt; We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we go into that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It &lt;unk&gt;s like God suddenly walks through the room. &lt;unk&gt; On The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour, &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was most often used to open concerts. Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting. The San Diego &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Tribune wrote that, &lt;unk&gt; From the &lt;unk&gt; sonic opening strains of &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt;, this audience was up, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where &lt;unk&gt; the power afforded their songs is scary &lt;unk&gt;, noting that during the song &lt;unk&gt;s opening, &lt;unk&gt; the arena &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In other reviews, the song was called : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; powerful &lt;unk&gt;. Out of the &lt;unk&gt; shows during The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour, &lt;unk&gt; Streets &lt;unk&gt; was played at all except &lt;unk&gt; of the concerts. During the &lt;unk&gt; Tour which took place in &lt;unk&gt; and the beginning of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Streets &lt;unk&gt; was only left out of the set list at one of the &lt;unk&gt; concerts. The song was performed at every show on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Tour. Concerts from this tour were elaborate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Bono performed as a variety of characters, but for the end of the main set, the group reverted to playing classics, including &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, straight. Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree &lt;unk&gt;s photo shoot. The video was &lt;unk&gt; up for humorous effect &lt;unk&gt; NME described the effect as giving it a &lt;unk&gt; silly, Charlie &lt;unk&gt; quality &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens. This video would make a return during performances on the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; legs of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tour. Some of the Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt; synthpop cover of the song ( titled &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can &lt;unk&gt;t Take My Eyes off You &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt; cover. Critics welcomed the song in the group &lt;unk&gt;s setlist : The Independent said the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; instant euphoria, as &lt;unk&gt; do what they &lt;unk&gt;re best at, slipping into epic rock mode, playing music made for the arena &lt;unk&gt;. In two other local newspaper reviews, critics praised the song &lt;unk&gt;s inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits. For the PopMart Tour of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Tour. The set &lt;unk&gt;s massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an &lt;unk&gt; astonishing, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style trip into the heart of a &lt;unk&gt;, psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Near the end of the song, peace &lt;unk&gt; were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set &lt;unk&gt;s golden arch were projected upwards. Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;FO landing site &lt;unk&gt;. Shortly before the third leg of the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, the September &lt;unk&gt; attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band &lt;unk&gt;s first show in New York City following the attacks, the band performed &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, and when the stage lights illuminated the audience, the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. The experience was one inspiration for the song &lt;unk&gt; City of &lt;unk&gt; Lights &lt;unk&gt;. The band paid tribute to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl &lt;unk&gt; halftime show on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The performance featured the names of the September &lt;unk&gt; victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s appearance was later ranked number &lt;unk&gt; on Sports Illustrated &lt;unk&gt;s list of &lt;unk&gt; Top &lt;unk&gt; Super Bowl &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. For the &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour, the group originally considered dropping the song from their &lt;unk&gt;, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song, which were accompanied by the stage &lt;unk&gt;s LED video &lt;unk&gt; displaying African flags. On the tour &lt;unk&gt;s opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, &lt;unk&gt; And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the stuff about &lt;unk&gt; lands and &lt;unk&gt; making sense for the first time. &lt;unk&gt; The song was also played at the preview screening of the band &lt;unk&gt;s concert film &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;D at the &lt;unk&gt; Cannes Film Festival. At the Glastonbury Festival &lt;unk&gt;, The Edge accompanied rock band &lt;unk&gt; for a live cover version of the track, later playing it with &lt;unk&gt; while headlining Glastonbury in &lt;unk&gt;. Live performances of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum, Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; : Live from Sydney, and PopMart : Live from Mexico City, as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts, Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Live and Hasta la &lt;unk&gt;ista Baby! &lt;unk&gt; Live from Mexico City. A second version from the PopMart Tour was featured on Please : &lt;unk&gt; Live EP, and later on the &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt; Please &lt;unk&gt; single. A live recording from Boston during the &lt;unk&gt; Tour was featured in the concert film &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : Live from Boston, and on the &lt;unk&gt; Walk On &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Electrical Storm &lt;unk&gt; singles. The concert video and album &lt;unk&gt; Go Home : Live from &lt;unk&gt; Castle, Ireland featured another performance from the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, and later performances were featured in the concert films &lt;unk&gt;ertigo &lt;unk&gt; : Live from Chicago and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;D ( &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Rose Bowl ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tour &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; digital album, Live from the Point Depot, contains a performance from the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, only available as part of The Complete &lt;unk&gt; digital box set. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; magazine named &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; most exciting tune ever &lt;unk&gt;. The following year, &lt;unk&gt; ranked the song at number &lt;unk&gt; in a special edition titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Best Songs Ever &lt;unk&gt;. Three years later, the magazine &lt;unk&gt;s readers voted the track the &lt;unk&gt;rd &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; greatest song in history. Rolling Stone ranked the song at number &lt;unk&gt; on its list of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. &lt;unk&gt; In a &lt;unk&gt; poll by fan site &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; named &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; as their favourite song from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, ranking it as the most popular song from the album. In &lt;unk&gt;, American sports network ESPN used the track, among other &lt;unk&gt; songs, in commercials for the &lt;unk&gt; FIFA World Cup, with the South African &lt;unk&gt; Gospel Choir adding vocals to the song. The advertisement, titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Island &lt;unk&gt;, portrays South African political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team. There are plans to bring a recording of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; supported performance to retail. Composer &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; used the introductory guitar theme in his &lt;unk&gt; piece for wind ensemble, Aurora &lt;unk&gt;. The song &lt;unk&gt;s introduction was used by the &lt;unk&gt;ancouver Canucks hockey team at the start each of their home games, when the players take to the ice. The Baltimore &lt;unk&gt; also use the song as they enter M &lt;unk&gt; T Bank Stadium before home games. The Marquette Golden Eagles men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team uses this song in their entrance video before all home games at the &lt;unk&gt; Harris Bradley Center. The song is also used by the Wisconsin &lt;unk&gt; football team for their entrance video at Camp Randall Stadium prior to all home games. The Kansas &lt;unk&gt; men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team uses the song during their starting &lt;unk&gt; at Allen &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Track listing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Personnel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Charts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction ( often referred to as simply the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;. The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; while studying the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt;. As originally described, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; involves the activation of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or &lt;unk&gt; acid promoter. The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ring closure which forms the &lt;unk&gt; product ( See &lt;unk&gt; below &lt;unk&gt;. As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; provided that they follow a similar &lt;unk&gt; pathway. The success of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; as both motifs in natural products ( including &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;, and a &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and as useful synthetic &lt;unk&gt; for total synthesis. The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The mechanism of the classical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by &lt;unk&gt; to be an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and is outlined below. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; by the acid catalyst generates a &lt;unk&gt; cation which undergoes a &lt;unk&gt; allowed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as dictated by the Woodward &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Hoffman rules. This generates an &lt;unk&gt; cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hydrogen. Subsequent &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; produces the &lt;unk&gt; product. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known ; what &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in particular is the generation of the &lt;unk&gt; cation followed by &lt;unk&gt; ring closure to an &lt;unk&gt; cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The &lt;unk&gt; of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; substituted substrates having an increased population of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; due to &lt;unk&gt; strain. &lt;unk&gt; of an electron &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Similarly, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; substitution directed inward &lt;unk&gt; the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans conformation so severely that E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Z &lt;unk&gt; has been shown to occur in advance of &lt;unk&gt; on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans &lt;unk&gt; regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a rare example of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction, whereas most &lt;unk&gt; are &lt;unk&gt;. The example below uses &lt;unk&gt; hydride to trap the &lt;unk&gt; cation so that no elimination occurs. ( See &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; below &lt;unk&gt; Along this same vein, &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt; of the type studied extensively by Marcus &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a large amount of &lt;unk&gt; strain in the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Classical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Though &lt;unk&gt; following the general template above had been observed prior to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s involvement, it was his study of the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt; that marked the first major examination of this process. &lt;unk&gt; correctly reasoned that the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in situ to form a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; before ring closure to the &lt;unk&gt; product. The reaction shown below involves an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction to generate the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s when several syntheses employing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were published. &lt;unk&gt; below are key steps in the syntheses of &lt;unk&gt; and Nor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that generates the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The classical version of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to &lt;unk&gt;. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to &lt;unk&gt; ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and &lt;unk&gt; of the intermediate. Strong Lewis or &lt;unk&gt; acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These &lt;unk&gt; are not compatible with sensitive functional groups, limiting the substrate scope. Despite the &lt;unk&gt; possibility for catalysis, multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction. This limits the atom economy of the reaction. The elimination step is not &lt;unk&gt; ; if multiple &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are available for elimination, various products are often observed as mixtures. This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as &lt;unk&gt; separation is typically required. &lt;unk&gt; destroys a potential &lt;unk&gt;, decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; is sometimes not &lt;unk&gt;, meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern variants &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on &lt;unk&gt; its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, &lt;unk&gt; the reaction with more mild &lt;unk&gt; to improve functional group tolerance, directing the &lt;unk&gt; of the elimination step, and improving the overall &lt;unk&gt;. These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the &lt;unk&gt; cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the &lt;unk&gt; cation &lt;unk&gt; intercepted &lt;unk&gt; in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took advantage of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; silicon effect in order to direct the &lt;unk&gt; of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Illinois, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron &lt;unk&gt; to promote the reaction. With &lt;unk&gt; products, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was selected for to varying degrees. The silicon &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product &lt;unk&gt;, shown below. The &lt;unk&gt; takes place before elimination of the &lt;unk&gt; alcohol &lt;unk&gt;, so that the resulting &lt;unk&gt; of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; anti to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Drawing on the &lt;unk&gt; effects compiled over various trials of the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Rochester developed a paradigm for &lt;unk&gt; polarized &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in which electron &lt;unk&gt; and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl &lt;unk&gt; and vinyl &lt;unk&gt; in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; proton, allowing selective formation of the trans &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; via &lt;unk&gt;. It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a &lt;unk&gt; or withdrawing group alone, although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield, reaction time, etc. &lt;unk&gt; is typically lower. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Alternative cation generation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By extension, any &lt;unk&gt; cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. There have been a large number of examples published where the &lt;unk&gt; cation is arrived at by a variety of &lt;unk&gt;. One such example involves the silver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ring opening of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of &lt;unk&gt; silver chloride. In the total synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of a vinyl &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; likewise generates a &lt;unk&gt; cation via ring opening of the resultant &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Once the &lt;unk&gt; has occurred, an &lt;unk&gt; cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, respectively. &lt;unk&gt; cation trapping has been developed extensively by &lt;unk&gt; G. West of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Alberta and his review covers the field. The &lt;unk&gt; cation can be trapped with &lt;unk&gt; and carbon &lt;unk&gt; and can also undergo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with various &lt;unk&gt; partners. &lt;unk&gt; below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a &lt;unk&gt; core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity. &lt;unk&gt; trapping with various &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; less common. In one study, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is paired with a Michael reaction using an &lt;unk&gt; catalyst to initiate nucleophilic &lt;unk&gt; addition of the &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In this tandem reaction the &lt;unk&gt; catalyst is required for both &lt;unk&gt; : it acts as the Lewis acid in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and in the next step the &lt;unk&gt; group of &lt;unk&gt; first coordinates to &lt;unk&gt; in a ligand exchange with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; group. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; variants &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The development of an enantioselective &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a desirable addition to the repertoire of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are also known, in which extant &lt;unk&gt; direct the &lt;unk&gt;. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of &lt;unk&gt; ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in turn sets the &lt;unk&gt; as shown below. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; group acts to direct the &lt;unk&gt; by preventing the distant &lt;unk&gt; from rotating &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; it via unfavorable &lt;unk&gt; interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a &lt;unk&gt; auxiliary. ( The starting material is not &lt;unk&gt; but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; substrates can exhibit axial to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transfer if &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are used. The example below generates a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yield and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; enantiomeric excess. &lt;unk&gt; has additionally developed a camphor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based auxiliary for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;. The key step employs an unusual mixture of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as solvent. The first &lt;unk&gt; Lewis acid promoted asymmetric &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was reported by &lt;unk&gt; Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ligand complexes with up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Related Reactions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are generally also subsumed under the same name. For example, an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; can undergo a similar &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that is typically referred to as an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction. Other such extensions have been given similar names, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Because they &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; cation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; electron &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; often severely impede &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Building from this, several &lt;unk&gt; ring openings of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have been reported. These are typically referred to as retro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions &lt;unk&gt; have few instances ; there is one example of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reported ( shown below &lt;unk&gt;, and several &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor &lt;unk&gt;, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stabilization of the &lt;unk&gt; cation by electron donation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a &lt;unk&gt; American black comedy film directed by Seth Gordon, written by Michael &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;onathan Goldstein, based on a story by &lt;unk&gt;. It stars &lt;unk&gt;ason Bateman, Charlie Day, &lt;unk&gt;ason Sudeikis, &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, and &lt;unk&gt;amie &lt;unk&gt;. The plot follows three friends, played by Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, who decide to murder their respective overbearing, abusive bosses, portrayed by Spacey, Aniston and Farrell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s script was bought by New Line Cinema in &lt;unk&gt; and the film spent six years in various states of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; production, with a variety of actors attached to different roles. By &lt;unk&gt;, Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; had rewritten the script, and the film finally went into production. The film premiered in Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and received a wide release on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The film exceeded financial expectations, &lt;unk&gt; over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in the first three days, making it the number two film in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States during its opening weekend, and going on to become the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grossing black comedy film of all time in &lt;unk&gt; dollars, breaking the record previously set by The War of the Roses in &lt;unk&gt;. The film grossed over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film opened to positive critical reception, with several critics praising the ensemble cast, with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;. A sequel, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was released on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Nick &lt;unk&gt; ( Bateman &lt;unk&gt; and Dale &lt;unk&gt; ( Day &lt;unk&gt; are friends who &lt;unk&gt; their bosses.

He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness. Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with &lt;unk&gt;ones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for &lt;unk&gt; the film Snow Falling on &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ones suggests that they get &lt;unk&gt; to confess and secretly tape it.

They flee by car, but &lt;unk&gt; gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car &lt;unk&gt;s navigation &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; system operator &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Kurt &lt;unk&gt;s car, allowing &lt;unk&gt; to catch and hold them at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; shoots himself in the leg as he &lt;unk&gt; about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness. The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; he murdered &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is sentenced to &lt;unk&gt; years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails &lt;unk&gt;ulia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient, while &lt;unk&gt;ones secretly records the act. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cast &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ason Bateman as Nick &lt;unk&gt; An executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through &lt;unk&gt; in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him. &lt;unk&gt; wrote the role specifically for Bateman. Charlie Day as Dale &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss. Described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; romantic &lt;unk&gt; in love with his fianc&lt;unk&gt;e. Ashton &lt;unk&gt; was in talks for the role at two different points in the lengthy production. Day was considered for the role following his co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; starring performance with Sudeikis in the &lt;unk&gt; film Going the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reuters reported that industry &lt;unk&gt; believed his performance overshadowed the main stars. &lt;unk&gt;ason Sudeikis as Kurt &lt;unk&gt; An account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new, drug &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies. Sudeikis was cast in May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston as Dr. &lt;unk&gt;ulia Harris, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; based the character on a former boss, claiming she was &lt;unk&gt; very sexually aggressive with everybody &lt;unk&gt;. When writing the script, &lt;unk&gt; intended for the role to go to Aniston. He stated, &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; the aforementioned boss &lt;unk&gt; looked more like &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt;. It was like flirting with a &lt;unk&gt;. So I decided for the sake of the movie, let ’ s go with &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston. ” The actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role, wanting to look different from other characters she had played. Colin Farrell as Bobby &lt;unk&gt; Described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; corrupt and incompetent &lt;unk&gt; who &lt;unk&gt;s in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he &lt;unk&gt;s doing. &lt;unk&gt; Farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character, stating &lt;unk&gt; This guy thinks he &lt;unk&gt;s God &lt;unk&gt;s gift to women, God &lt;unk&gt;s gift to &lt;unk&gt;, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It &lt;unk&gt;s all part of his grandiose sense of self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; esteem, which is probably &lt;unk&gt; a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, and all kinds of other things. With &lt;unk&gt;, Seth gave me complete license to act as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up as possible. &lt;unk&gt; Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; belly and an affinity for Chinese &lt;unk&gt;. Kevin Spacey as David &lt;unk&gt; President of &lt;unk&gt; Industries. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman and &lt;unk&gt;eff Bridges had been approached by New Line Cinema to take the role, described as a &lt;unk&gt; master &lt;unk&gt; with an attractive wife. Spacey signed up for the role in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The part was considered &lt;unk&gt; integral &lt;unk&gt; to the film. Gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses ( rather than one single person &lt;unk&gt; to avoid being sued. &lt;unk&gt;amie &lt;unk&gt; as Dean &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones The character had the more &lt;unk&gt; colorful &lt;unk&gt; name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones &lt;unk&gt;, but it was changed at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s request, with producer &lt;unk&gt;ay Stern commenting that &lt;unk&gt; felt it &lt;unk&gt; was over the line &lt;unk&gt;. The current name was said to be subject to further change, prior to the release of the film. &lt;unk&gt; contributed to his character &lt;unk&gt;s appearance, suggesting full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tattoos and a retro clothing style. &lt;unk&gt; described the appearance as &lt;unk&gt; a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he &lt;unk&gt;s living in his own time capsule. When he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in. &lt;unk&gt; During the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year development of the film, several actors were in negotiations to star, including Owen Wilson, &lt;unk&gt;ince &lt;unk&gt;, Matthew &lt;unk&gt;, Ryan Reynolds, Dax Shepard, and &lt;unk&gt;ohnny &lt;unk&gt;. Donald Sutherland portrays &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt;, Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s father and Kurt &lt;unk&gt;s boss. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Isaiah &lt;unk&gt; was confirmed as joining the cast. &lt;unk&gt; was quoted as saying &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s a smaller role &lt;unk&gt;. He appears as Officer &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ulie Bowen appears in the film as &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s wife. Bowen stated that her character &lt;unk&gt; may or may not be a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous. &lt;unk&gt; Gruffudd has a cameo as a male prostitute erroneously hired as a &lt;unk&gt;. Lindsay &lt;unk&gt; appears as Dale &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Stacy. P. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; plays Kenny &lt;unk&gt;, a former investment manager, now &lt;unk&gt; for drinks, while Wendell Pierce and Ron White play a pair of &lt;unk&gt;. Bob &lt;unk&gt; makes a cameo as sadistic &lt;unk&gt; CEO Louis Sherman. &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt;, a screenwriter on the film, cameos as Nick &lt;unk&gt;s co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; worker Carter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Development &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s script for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s production company Rat Entertainment in &lt;unk&gt; for a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; figure amount. &lt;unk&gt; initially was interested in directing, but became occupied with directing the comedy Tower &lt;unk&gt;. Frank &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt; were in talks to direct. &lt;unk&gt;onathan Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt; rewrote the script in &lt;unk&gt;, and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production designer Shepherd &lt;unk&gt; specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses &lt;unk&gt; homes and offices. Nick and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s workplace is the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bullpen, which was designed to &lt;unk&gt; enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office. &lt;unk&gt; The design team met with financial &lt;unk&gt; and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking position in a &lt;unk&gt; and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with &lt;unk&gt; and set &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; to match &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s suit to that of the surrounding &lt;unk&gt; cold grey and blue &lt;unk&gt; color palette of his office. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s home was described as &lt;unk&gt; equally lacking in warmth &lt;unk&gt; as the office but more lavishly decorated and &lt;unk&gt; for show &lt;unk&gt;, including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his &lt;unk&gt; trophy wife &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt;s office was described as a &lt;unk&gt; challenge &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; sensual vibe &lt;unk&gt; into a &lt;unk&gt; office. &lt;unk&gt; approached the design through &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt;s mentality, stating, &lt;unk&gt; She &lt;unk&gt;s a Type A professional at the top of her game, who likes to play cat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mouse, so it &lt;unk&gt;s a completely controlled environment, with &lt;unk&gt; and views into other rooms so she always knows what &lt;unk&gt;s going on &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s highly designed, with rich &lt;unk&gt; and tones, &lt;unk&gt; artwork and subtle lighting &lt;unk&gt; all very &lt;unk&gt; till you step into her private office. The &lt;unk&gt; close, the door locks and you think, &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s the Temple of Doom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Similarly approaching the character &lt;unk&gt;s home, the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street &lt;unk&gt; which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn &lt;unk&gt;t get away with at work. &lt;unk&gt; Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s environments were designed with more contrast, the character being new to the work area. &lt;unk&gt; described the contrast as &lt;unk&gt; the company reflects &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; human touch, whereas &lt;unk&gt; Bobby &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; home is a &lt;unk&gt; shrine to himself and his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued, &lt;unk&gt; It features a &lt;unk&gt; of anything he finds exotic and erotic, mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Studio &lt;unk&gt; vibe, a makeshift &lt;unk&gt;, lots of mirrors and a &lt;unk&gt; table. &lt;unk&gt; Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon &lt;unk&gt;s interpretation of the character and his &lt;unk&gt; infatuation &lt;unk&gt; with martial arts and &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; of prowess &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filming of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took place in and around Los Angeles. The production team attempted to find locations &lt;unk&gt; that people haven &lt;unk&gt;t already seen a hundred times in movies and on T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America &lt;unk&gt; where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was represented by an office building in &lt;unk&gt;, California, with the crew building the set on a vacant floor. For &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chemical &lt;unk&gt;, the production team found a &lt;unk&gt; perfect landscape of pipes and containers &lt;unk&gt; in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of &lt;unk&gt;, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new &lt;unk&gt; to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland &lt;unk&gt;s character. A &lt;unk&gt; Friday &lt;unk&gt;s in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with &lt;unk&gt;ones was staged in downtown Los Angeles. The film was shot digitally using the &lt;unk&gt; Genesis camera. Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise, though Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stars, stating, &lt;unk&gt; My dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn ’ t much that I needed to do ”. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The soundtrack was composed by award &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; winning composer Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, with music contributed by Mike &lt;unk&gt; of Pearl &lt;unk&gt;am, Stefan &lt;unk&gt; of Dave Matthews Band and Money Mark &lt;unk&gt; a collaborator with the &lt;unk&gt; Boys. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Mark worked with musicians Matt Chamberlain, David &lt;unk&gt;, Aaron Kaplan, &lt;unk&gt;ictor &lt;unk&gt;, Chris &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and D&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to develop the music. Major contributions were provided by Mark on keyboard, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; on guitar, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; on bass, &lt;unk&gt; on drums and D&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; recorded the soundtrack at The &lt;unk&gt;illage recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to remain &lt;unk&gt; authentic &lt;unk&gt; to the characters &lt;unk&gt; progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, &lt;unk&gt; The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn &lt;unk&gt;t over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced or &lt;unk&gt; and digital in any way. It &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, noisy, and full of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. I knew that if we could &lt;unk&gt; some of this sonic magic in the score, then the &lt;unk&gt; and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued, &lt;unk&gt; We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same &lt;unk&gt; that Money Mark played on Beck &lt;unk&gt;s classic ‘ Where It &lt;unk&gt;s At ’. At the end of the day, Seth &lt;unk&gt; Gordon &lt;unk&gt; and I wanted to produce a score that is as &lt;unk&gt; and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it... and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, by &lt;unk&gt; Music.

Lisa &lt;unk&gt; of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively, calling the film &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;, well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; built, &lt;unk&gt; nasty tale of resentment, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; revenge &lt;unk&gt; and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club &lt;unk&gt;s Nathan &lt;unk&gt; also praised the cast, stating that the picture &lt;unk&gt; succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, adding the &lt;unk&gt; acting more than &lt;unk&gt; for the film &lt;unk&gt;s other failings. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; singled out Day &lt;unk&gt;s performance as &lt;unk&gt; a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Edward Douglas of &lt;unk&gt; credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled &lt;unk&gt; the perfect cast &lt;unk&gt;, claiming &lt;unk&gt; the six leads kill in every scene &lt;unk&gt;, but echoed Nathan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sentiments that Day is the &lt;unk&gt; real standout &lt;unk&gt;. Douglas summarized the picture as &lt;unk&gt; dark fun that works better than expected due to a well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; developed script, an &lt;unk&gt; cast and a director who knows how to put the two together &lt;unk&gt;.

Scott of The New York Times stated &lt;unk&gt; the timing of the cast... is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and appreciated that the script did not attempt &lt;unk&gt; to cut its &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; dose of &lt;unk&gt; or respectability &lt;unk&gt;. The review concluded that &lt;unk&gt; in the ways that count and even when it shouldn ’ t, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; works. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;SA Today &lt;unk&gt;s Scott &lt;unk&gt; awarded the film three out of four stars, labeling it a &lt;unk&gt; surprising comedy that rivals &lt;unk&gt; as the funniest film of the summer, if not the year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; added that &lt;unk&gt; the characters are so likable &lt;unk&gt;, giving particular credit to Sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of Bateman and Day. The dialogue was also lauded by &lt;unk&gt;, which commented that &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon has a &lt;unk&gt; touch with water &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; cooler talk &lt;unk&gt; even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison. &lt;unk&gt; Leonard &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; considered Day to have had the &lt;unk&gt; breakout role &lt;unk&gt; and offered praise to the performances of the cast, but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell &lt;unk&gt;s character. &lt;unk&gt; concluded &lt;unk&gt; the movie has just enough &lt;unk&gt; to identify it as a &lt;unk&gt; comedy, just enough &lt;unk&gt; to admire, and just the right &lt;unk&gt; among its three male stars, which turns out to be the movie ’ s greatest strength. &lt;unk&gt; Rolling Stone &lt;unk&gt;s Peter Travers gave &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; killer cast &lt;unk&gt;, with specific credit given to Bateman and Day, but was critical of the movie, stating &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt; out on a sharp premise &lt;unk&gt; and that it is a &lt;unk&gt; hit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; miss farce that leaves you wishing it was &lt;unk&gt; than it is &lt;unk&gt; The Guardian &lt;unk&gt;s Philip French called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a lumbering, &lt;unk&gt; affair &lt;unk&gt;, but admitted &lt;unk&gt; I laughed frequently, probably to the &lt;unk&gt; of my self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; respect. &lt;unk&gt; Nicholas &lt;unk&gt; of The Independent gave a positive review, complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors &lt;unk&gt; improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing, but felt the movie was not as &lt;unk&gt; dark &lt;unk&gt; as its premise required, saying &lt;unk&gt; what &lt;unk&gt; the film does have comes instead from the &lt;unk&gt; quantity of &lt;unk&gt;, plus a &lt;unk&gt; of homophobia and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Salon &lt;unk&gt;s Andrew O &lt;unk&gt; offered a mixed response, characterizing the film as a &lt;unk&gt; lot &lt;unk&gt; in theory than in practice, but it won &lt;unk&gt;t ruin your Saturday night &lt;unk&gt;. Salon appreciated the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; comic chemistry &lt;unk&gt; between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O &lt;unk&gt; was however critical of the perceived homophobia, &lt;unk&gt; and racism. The Hollywood Reporter &lt;unk&gt;s Kirk &lt;unk&gt; responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon shows no &lt;unk&gt; for turning the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; characters in the script... into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate &lt;unk&gt; rage &lt;unk&gt; against the characters &lt;unk&gt; bosses, stating &lt;unk&gt;... there &lt;unk&gt;s every sign that, even without these particular &lt;unk&gt;, Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be &lt;unk&gt; for lack of a better word &lt;unk&gt; total &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; felt that the humor was &lt;unk&gt; rarely actually laugh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loud funny, and never truly dark or daring &lt;unk&gt;. She particularly criticized the all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with &lt;unk&gt; stereotypes &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ustin Chang of &lt;unk&gt;ariety praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, vulgar and juvenile &lt;unk&gt;. Chang echoed the sentiments of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to &lt;unk&gt; darker, more daring territory &lt;unk&gt; and faulted it for falling back on &lt;unk&gt; over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; top comic exaggeration &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accolades &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The film received several award nominations, including a &lt;unk&gt; Award for Best Supporting Actor for Colin Farrell, and three nominations from the &lt;unk&gt; Comedy Awards, including Comedy Actor for Bateman, Comedy Actress for Aniston, and best Comedy Film. Farrell and Aniston were both nominated for Best On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Screen Dirt &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; MT&lt;unk&gt; Movie Awards, with Aniston claiming the award. Farrell also received a nomination for Best On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Screen &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Home media &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; obtained the rights to the network premiere of the film. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was released on D&lt;unk&gt;D and Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The D&lt;unk&gt;D version sold an estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; units in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States during its first week, earning approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. It was the number &lt;unk&gt; best selling D&lt;unk&gt;D of the week, finishing behind Green Lantern, and the number &lt;unk&gt; Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray disc film behind Green Lantern and The Lion King. As of November &lt;unk&gt;, it has sold an estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million units and earned &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. The D&lt;unk&gt;D contains the theatrical cut of the film and deleted scenes. The Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc edition contains the Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc, the D&lt;unk&gt;D and a digital version of the film in a single pack.

Beginning with the Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc release of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Green Lantern, Warner Bros. included a code that allows the owner to access a version of the film via &lt;unk&gt;, a cloud storage service which allows streaming or downloading to a variety of devices. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon confirmed in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; that talks were underway for a sequel, after the financial success of the film in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, saying : &lt;unk&gt; Yeah, we &lt;unk&gt;ve definitely discussed it. It &lt;unk&gt;s done well in the States, the film has, so that &lt;unk&gt;s becoming a more &lt;unk&gt; effort now, we &lt;unk&gt;re trying to figure out what the sequel could be. &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was confirmed that a sequel was moving forward, and that Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; would be returning to write the script. New Line was reported to be negotiating with Gordon to return as director, with Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis also expected to return to their roles. On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was confirmed that Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; were in the process of writing the new script. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; confirmed that they had submitted multiple draft scripts for the sequel, and that production had moved towards &lt;unk&gt; the budget. Later in the same month Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were confirmed to be reprising their roles, with &lt;unk&gt; negotiating to return. The film will again be produced by Brett &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ay Stern. In August &lt;unk&gt;, it was announced that Gordon would not be returning to direct because of scheduling conflicts and that the studio was actively searching for a replacement. In September &lt;unk&gt;, Sean Anders was announced as Gordon &lt;unk&gt;s replacement, with &lt;unk&gt;ohn Morris joining the production as a producer. The pair had previously performed a rewrite on Goldstein &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sequel script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in summer &lt;unk&gt;, but began in November &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey reprised their roles, with Christoph &lt;unk&gt; and Chris Pine joining the cast.  &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, which was commissioned to mark the &lt;unk&gt; Commonwealth Games ; it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the &lt;unk&gt;K until the completion of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the &lt;unk&gt; Tower of &lt;unk&gt;. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Christie, in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the starting pistol, but at &lt;unk&gt; the B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt;. The sculpture was commissioned in &lt;unk&gt; ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; court settlement totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. In February &lt;unk&gt;, Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential &lt;unk&gt;, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt; spikes remain in storage. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design and statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang originally stood &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall with &lt;unk&gt; hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core. It was angled at &lt;unk&gt; degrees and supported by five &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; long, tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; above the ground. The sculpture weighed &lt;unk&gt; tonnes, with the concrete in the foundations weighing over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tonnes, including a &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt; reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; deep. The sculpture was made from the same &lt;unk&gt; steel ( also known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; as the Angel of the North sculpture, which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its &lt;unk&gt; to water. As part of the design, the spikes &lt;unk&gt; slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture, containing children &lt;unk&gt;s poems and paintings, due to be opened circa &lt;unk&gt;. The location of the time capsule after &lt;unk&gt; is currently unknown. B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at &lt;unk&gt;, in &lt;unk&gt;, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ;. It took its name from a quotation of British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the starting pistol, but at &lt;unk&gt; The B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt;. The artwork had been nicknamed &lt;unk&gt; by the locals after the popular children &lt;unk&gt;s game from the &lt;unk&gt;s. Prior to the construction of &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Nottingham, B of the Bang was Britain &lt;unk&gt;s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North, which stands at &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. It was designed to look like an exploding &lt;unk&gt; and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the &lt;unk&gt; Tower of &lt;unk&gt;. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the &lt;unk&gt; Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in &lt;unk&gt; and was designed by Thomas &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Construction and funding &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; Studio, &lt;unk&gt; Lucas, Flint and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Structures. It was approved at the start of &lt;unk&gt;, with the central core arriving in Manchester on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August &lt;unk&gt;, after which the &lt;unk&gt; spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang. The official unveiling by &lt;unk&gt; Christie took place on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. In total the sculpture cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million to design and construct &lt;unk&gt; twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the North West Development Agency, contributing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Manchester City Council providing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Structural problems and legal action &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The tip of one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned. Four months later, in May &lt;unk&gt;, a second spike had to be cut off by &lt;unk&gt; after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of &lt;unk&gt; tip weights to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the spikes &lt;unk&gt; weights. Despite these modifications, B of the Bang remained &lt;unk&gt; off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to &lt;unk&gt; Get It &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In May &lt;unk&gt; a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for &lt;unk&gt; analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel. It was announced in October &lt;unk&gt; that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November &lt;unk&gt; this culminated in an out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project &lt;unk&gt;s designers Thomas &lt;unk&gt; Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lucas Ltd, Flint and &lt;unk&gt; Partnership and &lt;unk&gt; Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in damages for breach of contract and negligence. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Acting on a report in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe &lt;unk&gt;. The report recognised the sculpture &lt;unk&gt;s aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with &lt;unk&gt; made from carbon fibre, although the report &lt;unk&gt; the necessity for extensive testing. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Antony &lt;unk&gt;, creator of the Angel of the North &lt;unk&gt; to which B of the Bang is often compared &lt;unk&gt; spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, &lt;unk&gt; It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Despite &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plea, removal of B of the Bang began in April &lt;unk&gt;. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm &lt;unk&gt; Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with &lt;unk&gt; cutting equipment. Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture &lt;unk&gt;s return, and in early &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the core was sold as scrap for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; is the second episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by executive producer &lt;unk&gt;eff Pinkner and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;. Abrams, Alex &lt;unk&gt;, and Roberto Orci. When developing the series, they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was the first regular episode of Fringe, and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series. It was directed by Paul A. Edwards. After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old man, Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv &lt;unk&gt; and consultants Peter ( &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt; and Walter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Noble &lt;unk&gt; investigate. They tie the case to the murders of young women, who have all had their &lt;unk&gt; glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus &lt;unk&gt; ( Mark &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an expert in &lt;unk&gt;, is working to help his son Christopher ( Derek Cecil &lt;unk&gt; stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; first aired in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on Fox. An estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers watched the episode, a &lt;unk&gt; percent increase from the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics &lt;unk&gt; reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a &lt;unk&gt; section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old man. Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv &lt;unk&gt;, Peter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt;, and Walter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Noble &lt;unk&gt;, new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip &lt;unk&gt; ( Lance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, believing the case to be part of &lt;unk&gt; The Pattern &lt;unk&gt;, a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local &lt;unk&gt;, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner &lt;unk&gt;ohn Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would &lt;unk&gt; his victims, young women, then make an &lt;unk&gt; along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he &lt;unk&gt; his car that contains the related files. Once they are retrieved, Olivia makes a connection to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which controls growth in humans, and informs Charlie Francis ( Kirk &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to monitor recent cases where the victims &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been removed. Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in &lt;unk&gt;, Dr. &lt;unk&gt; ( Mark &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to trying to learn more about rapid aging, but Dr. &lt;unk&gt; cannot help them further, though Peter suspects he is hiding something. &lt;unk&gt;nseen by the Fringe division, Dr. &lt;unk&gt; visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer, Christopher ( Derek Cecil &lt;unk&gt;, his son, who suffers from rapid aging syndrome. &lt;unk&gt; warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process. By this time, Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia &lt;unk&gt;s serial murderer. At Walter &lt;unk&gt;s lab, they identify the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been removed. They &lt;unk&gt; the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process. Walter &lt;unk&gt; they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman &lt;unk&gt;s optical nerves induced by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic, they discover the image of a suspension bridge near &lt;unk&gt; and identify the likely location from which it was viewed &lt;unk&gt; the same warehouse that Dr. &lt;unk&gt; visited. The FBI converge on the building, and Olivia and Peter find &lt;unk&gt; about to cut into another victim. Olivia chases off after Christopher, who eventually &lt;unk&gt; to his rapid aging and dies, while Peter, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a bullet, &lt;unk&gt; with Walter to apply a makeshift &lt;unk&gt; to bring the victim back to life. As they &lt;unk&gt; up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to &lt;unk&gt; their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of &lt;unk&gt;, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter &lt;unk&gt;s childhood are void of any details. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;. Abrams, Alex &lt;unk&gt; and Roberto Orci, and executive producer &lt;unk&gt;eff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams &lt;unk&gt; television series &lt;unk&gt;. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and &lt;unk&gt; : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. &lt;unk&gt; explained, &lt;unk&gt; While we make sure that our episodes are self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; contained &lt;unk&gt; have a beginning, a middle, and an end &lt;unk&gt; the character stories can be serialized. They don &lt;unk&gt;t have to resolve themselves over the course of one show. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series &lt;unk&gt; different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley &lt;unk&gt;s head. &lt;unk&gt;sing plaster to make a prosthetic, they &lt;unk&gt; drilled out the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ed &lt;unk&gt; it open and &lt;unk&gt; went &lt;unk&gt; through a series of molds. &lt;unk&gt; Stanley stated that &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it &lt;unk&gt;s very gruesome because the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s popping out. &lt;unk&gt; The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gun &lt;unk&gt; ; according to prop master Peter &lt;unk&gt;, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people &lt;unk&gt;s clothing for concealed weapons. &lt;unk&gt;F&lt;unk&gt; Supervisor Christopher &lt;unk&gt; explained that for the eye &lt;unk&gt;s last vision, they used &lt;unk&gt; a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location, &lt;unk&gt; which they then used to &lt;unk&gt; take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher &lt;unk&gt; and Mark &lt;unk&gt; as his father, Dr. Claus &lt;unk&gt;. Other guest actors included Betty &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Amber &lt;unk&gt; Daisy &lt;unk&gt;, Bernie &lt;unk&gt; as old Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, Carmen &lt;unk&gt; as Amy, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones as a doctor, and Karin &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt;ohn Scott &lt;unk&gt;s sister. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ratings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was watched by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, a &lt;unk&gt; percent increase of four million from the pilot. Fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years. Its high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated lead &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, House, helped boost Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s ratings for the night, as &lt;unk&gt; percent of House &lt;unk&gt;s total audience and &lt;unk&gt; percent of &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds stayed to watch Fringe. Fringe was also the highest rated program for male &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds that evening. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reviews &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from television critics. T&lt;unk&gt; Squad writer &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; thought the episode seemed &lt;unk&gt; all over the place &lt;unk&gt;, and wasn &lt;unk&gt;t sure what to think. She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl &lt;unk&gt;s eye in order to identity her killer, and the &lt;unk&gt; at the very end, when Walter states &lt;unk&gt; If you &lt;unk&gt;ve read my file, then you know the truth about Peter &lt;unk&gt;s medical history &lt;unk&gt;. Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot ; though it was &lt;unk&gt; laden with lots of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and clich&lt;unk&gt;d dialogue, &lt;unk&gt; Fickett understood that it was needed to &lt;unk&gt; new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a &lt;unk&gt; great show &lt;unk&gt;, and he also praised the production level as &lt;unk&gt; top notch &lt;unk&gt;, and Torv &lt;unk&gt;s performance as &lt;unk&gt; very good &lt;unk&gt; as she &lt;unk&gt; brings a unique presence to the show &lt;unk&gt;. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C &lt;unk&gt;, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. &lt;unk&gt;osh &lt;unk&gt;ackson of Paste Magazine disliked the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ex &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; aspects that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; solved the puzzles of the first two episodes &lt;unk&gt;, and also criticized perceived &lt;unk&gt; plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim. Despite these flaws, &lt;unk&gt;ackson said he would tune in next week because he would &lt;unk&gt; rather have a show &lt;unk&gt; on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable, and I &lt;unk&gt;m interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve &lt;unk&gt;. Erin Fox of T&lt;unk&gt; Guide also liked &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; better than the pilot because she thought that it &lt;unk&gt; had really cool special effects, awesome Walter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; we also got to &lt;unk&gt; more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt;GO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes, but &lt;unk&gt; after sitting down to watch Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s second episode, &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt;, my concerns have vanished. Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without &lt;unk&gt; any of Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s eleven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files is even better defined in the first weekly &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; episode. I &lt;unk&gt;d struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more &lt;unk&gt; space. &lt;unk&gt; Another &lt;unk&gt;GO writer, Alex &lt;unk&gt;, later compared &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; to the similarly &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; plotted The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files episode &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; concluded that &lt;unk&gt; Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt;, commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stump bonnet cap, is a species of mushroom in the family &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; edible mushroom has a reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped cap up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; in diameter. The thin stem is up to &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; tall, whitish to yellow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The gills are pale brown to pinkish, and the spore print is white. It is a widespread saprobic fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, &lt;unk&gt;, and North America, where it grows in small groups or &lt;unk&gt; on fallen logs and stumps, especially of oak. British mycologist &lt;unk&gt; Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo. &lt;unk&gt; species with which M. &lt;unk&gt; may be confused include M. galericulata and M. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First described as Agaricus &lt;unk&gt; by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in &lt;unk&gt;, it was assigned its current name in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Mycena galericulata var. &lt;unk&gt; ( named by &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and its &lt;unk&gt; Agaricus &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt; ( named by Fries in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, are synonyms. In a molecular study of the large &lt;unk&gt; ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt; was found to be closely related to M. &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt;, and M. &lt;unk&gt;. The specific epithet &lt;unk&gt; means &lt;unk&gt; bent in &lt;unk&gt;. The mushroom is commonly known as the &lt;unk&gt; clustered bonnet &lt;unk&gt; or the &lt;unk&gt; oak &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stump bonnet cap &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The cap is light reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, with a diameter typically ranging from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Initially &lt;unk&gt; to bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped to convex, it &lt;unk&gt; during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap. The margin of the cap has minute but distinct &lt;unk&gt;. The surface is moist and smooth, and &lt;unk&gt;. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap &lt;unk&gt;. The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly &lt;unk&gt; odor and taste. The gills have a &lt;unk&gt; attachment to the stem ( that is, running down the length of the stem &lt;unk&gt; and are a pale brownish color with &lt;unk&gt; of red. They are broad ( between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;, and have a close to &lt;unk&gt; spacing, with about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gills reaching the stem. The fragile stem is &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; long by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; thick and yellow to yellow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, becoming reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown to orange &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white &lt;unk&gt;. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is &lt;unk&gt; doubtful &lt;unk&gt; and consumption &lt;unk&gt; best avoided &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Microscopic characteristics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The spores are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;m, broadly ellipsoid, smooth, and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with Melzer &lt;unk&gt;s reagent &lt;unk&gt;. The basidia ( spore &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bearing cells &lt;unk&gt; are four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; spored. The &lt;unk&gt; ( cystidia on the gill face &lt;unk&gt; are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge &lt;unk&gt; are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;m, and have tips that are covered with &lt;unk&gt; projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is &lt;unk&gt;, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct &lt;unk&gt;, a well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; differentiated &lt;unk&gt; ( a region of tissue immediately under the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; body ( gill tissue &lt;unk&gt; ; it is pale yellowish to &lt;unk&gt; brownish in iodine stain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Corner defined the varieties M. &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt; and var. &lt;unk&gt; in his &lt;unk&gt; publication on &lt;unk&gt; mushrooms of &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; region &lt;unk&gt; the boundary of the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The variety &lt;unk&gt; ( named after its type locality, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has a cap margin that is not &lt;unk&gt;, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a stone oak tree in the beech family. &lt;unk&gt;ariety &lt;unk&gt;, found in &lt;unk&gt;, has spores that are almost spherical. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Similar species &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; bears some resemblance to M. &lt;unk&gt;, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. &lt;unk&gt;. M. &lt;unk&gt; is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a &lt;unk&gt; conical cap that is dull gray &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; veins. M. &lt;unk&gt; has a &lt;unk&gt; stem that is bluish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gray. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Habitat and distribution &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It &lt;unk&gt; this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena &lt;unk&gt; grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut &lt;unk&gt; during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, &lt;unk&gt; mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, &lt;unk&gt;apan, &lt;unk&gt;, Turkey, and New Zealand. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chemistry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in &lt;unk&gt; ( Turkey &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt; was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( &lt;unk&gt; mg per kg &lt;unk&gt; and nickel ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mg &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt;, measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum. The fungus has been investigated for its ability to &lt;unk&gt; synthetic &lt;unk&gt; that are used in the textile, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; industries. The &lt;unk&gt; are not readily biodegradable, and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic.  &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a population of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of &lt;unk&gt; hectares ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square miles &lt;unk&gt;, Papa &lt;unk&gt; is the eighth largest island in Shetland. &lt;unk&gt; of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, &lt;unk&gt;, arches, &lt;unk&gt;, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation. The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites, as well as the remains of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island. The population reached &lt;unk&gt; or more in the nineteenth century, when a fishing station was opened at &lt;unk&gt; in West &lt;unk&gt;. Subsequently there was a steady decline in population, although the numbers have increased from a low of &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Today the main settlement on the island is &lt;unk&gt;, just to the east of which is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from where the &lt;unk&gt; ferry arrives from its base at West &lt;unk&gt; on the Shetland &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, especially sheep rearing, is the mainstay of island life. Numerous &lt;unk&gt; have occurred around the coast, and the celebrated poem Da Sang o da Papa Men by &lt;unk&gt; recalls the drama of the days when Papa &lt;unk&gt; was a centre for deep &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sea fishing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay. There are &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; of rugged coastline which is &lt;unk&gt; by numerous small &lt;unk&gt; and four larger &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; harbour bay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the east ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; house bay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry &lt;unk&gt;s embarkation point. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guard the harbour entrance to the south. The former is a &lt;unk&gt; island and was a &lt;unk&gt; colony until the &lt;unk&gt;th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; there were suffering from a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rather than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The latter &lt;unk&gt;s name relates to a story from the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Lord &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top, whose ruins are still visible, in order to &lt;unk&gt; preserve &lt;unk&gt; his daughter from men. &lt;unk&gt;nfortunately for his plans, when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story, she and her fisherman &lt;unk&gt; successfully &lt;unk&gt;. West &lt;unk&gt;, the inner part of which is called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the main &lt;unk&gt; in the north coast, the smaller &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lying immediately to the west. The main settlement on the island today is &lt;unk&gt;, which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and is surrounded by in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bye land to the east of the hill &lt;unk&gt; ( which runs south from West &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. To the west the island is &lt;unk&gt; by a belt of glacial &lt;unk&gt; about one and a half kilometres in length. Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow &lt;unk&gt; soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to &lt;unk&gt; turf &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior. The highest point on the island is in the north west at &lt;unk&gt; Field, which rises to &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is possibly from the Old Norse for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of stones &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; List of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In addition to the larger &lt;unk&gt; mentioned above there are various other &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; around the coast of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. They include : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Horn, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lie &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the north west. They include : &lt;unk&gt;, North &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and The &lt;unk&gt;. In between Papa &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lies the shallow bank of Papa &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Stuart Hill, the owner and only resident of the &lt;unk&gt; hectare ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres &lt;unk&gt; island of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( which he has renamed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Island &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made a declaration of dependence, creating the Crown &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King &lt;unk&gt;ames III of Scotland that dates to &lt;unk&gt;, Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency, and thus not a part of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom or of the European &lt;unk&gt;nion. This claim was not recognised by the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and &lt;unk&gt; rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish &lt;unk&gt; formed part of the Old Red &lt;unk&gt; Continent and lay some &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees south of the equator. The &lt;unk&gt; of Old Red &lt;unk&gt;, laid down from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; million years ago, were created as earlier &lt;unk&gt; rocks, &lt;unk&gt; by the formation of &lt;unk&gt;, eroded and then were deposited into river &lt;unk&gt;. The freshwater Lake &lt;unk&gt; existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa &lt;unk&gt; is largely made up of ashes and &lt;unk&gt; from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but there is also a Devonian fish bed at &lt;unk&gt; Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, &lt;unk&gt;, arches, &lt;unk&gt;, cliffs, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; that are amongst the finest in Britain. The &lt;unk&gt; Holl o &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a cave that passes right through the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west tip of the island. It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through. &lt;unk&gt; ( or Christie &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave, part of the roof of which collapsed in &lt;unk&gt;. Yet another is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Hole &lt;unk&gt; close to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the west. This was the favourite of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Tudor who wrote of the island in his &lt;unk&gt;ictorian memoirs and described the cave as :... in &lt;unk&gt;, so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so &lt;unk&gt; is the water... &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; like &lt;unk&gt; in a church. In &lt;unk&gt; the spectacular headland, &lt;unk&gt; Da Horn o Papa &lt;unk&gt; fell into the sea during a storm. The nearby &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ecology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, grey seals, killer &lt;unk&gt; and harbour &lt;unk&gt; are frequently seen on and around Papa &lt;unk&gt;. Atlantic &lt;unk&gt;, Arctic and common &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Arctic &lt;unk&gt;, northern &lt;unk&gt;, common &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, ringed &lt;unk&gt; and great black &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backed gull all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded. There is a &lt;unk&gt; of wild flowers, including mountain &lt;unk&gt;, spring &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as well as the ubiquitous &lt;unk&gt;. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa &lt;unk&gt; are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History and archaeology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Human settlement of the island dates from circa &lt;unk&gt; BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as &lt;unk&gt; heel &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Little is known of the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Celtic and Celtic eras, but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meaning &lt;unk&gt; Big island of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Celtic monks &lt;unk&gt;, in distinction to Papa Little some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the west. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Norse period &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is the subject of a &lt;unk&gt; manuscript written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was later to become King &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which are the remains of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was accused of corruption in the &lt;unk&gt; document and was later called ‘ &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; ’. ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above. &lt;unk&gt; The remains of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s thirteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century house are still visible near &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scots rule and fishing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt; Shetland came under nominal Scottish control, although the Norse &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Norway &lt;unk&gt; kept their Papa &lt;unk&gt; estates until the &lt;unk&gt;th century. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century merchants from &lt;unk&gt; and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, two Scottish &lt;unk&gt;, Thomas &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, and Arthur &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous &lt;unk&gt; ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; deep sea &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; boats known as &lt;unk&gt;. In addition to the &lt;unk&gt; colony on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; there may have been another at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; overlooking &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed &lt;unk&gt;th century colony. The island church, which &lt;unk&gt; Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore &lt;unk&gt;, was founded in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of &lt;unk&gt;. It is called the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as &lt;unk&gt; the site of a &lt;unk&gt; chapel belonging to about the twelfth century &lt;unk&gt;. There is a tradition that the work there was &lt;unk&gt; with by supernatural powers and that each day &lt;unk&gt;s work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the &lt;unk&gt; were moved overnight by these &lt;unk&gt; agencies to the present site of the church and work was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; commenced there successfully. Excavations in &lt;unk&gt; found little besides large blocks of &lt;unk&gt; and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century the &lt;unk&gt; fishing station in West &lt;unk&gt; was opened and the island had a population of &lt;unk&gt; people or more. However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam &lt;unk&gt; saw a fall in population from the &lt;unk&gt;s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the &lt;unk&gt;th Earl of &lt;unk&gt;, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent &lt;unk&gt; years as a prisoner before the &lt;unk&gt;uaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in &lt;unk&gt;. Lindsay &lt;unk&gt;s Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe. There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or &lt;unk&gt; Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower &lt;unk&gt;, and a rotating upper &lt;unk&gt; driven by the water falling onto the &lt;unk&gt; below. Some were still in use on Papa &lt;unk&gt; in the early years of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of &lt;unk&gt;, at &lt;unk&gt; in the south &lt;unk&gt; of Shetland. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;st centuries &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In common with many small Scottish islands, Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population peaked in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By &lt;unk&gt; the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen &lt;unk&gt; fairly elderly &lt;unk&gt; residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A &lt;unk&gt; and five sheep were offered free of charge to &lt;unk&gt; which brought a flood of applicants. By &lt;unk&gt; the census recorded a population of &lt;unk&gt;. However, by &lt;unk&gt; the population had fallen to &lt;unk&gt; after serious &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early &lt;unk&gt; the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The &lt;unk&gt; census recorded a usually resident population of &lt;unk&gt; - during the decade &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scottish island populations as a whole grew by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Overview of population trends &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The coasts around Papa &lt;unk&gt; have claimed numerous wrecks. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alone has sunk Dutch, French, German and Norwegian ships. The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles northwest of Papa &lt;unk&gt;, on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; while on her way to the village of &lt;unk&gt; to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the &lt;unk&gt; and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time &lt;unk&gt;, weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the &lt;unk&gt;. A request had been made for the &lt;unk&gt; lifeboat from Orkney, only &lt;unk&gt; miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All &lt;unk&gt; crew perished in the wreck. Only &lt;unk&gt; bodies were recovered, that of &lt;unk&gt;ames Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which were buried in &lt;unk&gt;. The cargo ship SS &lt;unk&gt; ran aground in fog on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt;. On this occasion the conditions were &lt;unk&gt; and only the ship and cargo were lost. In &lt;unk&gt; the Aberdeen trawler &lt;unk&gt; ran aground in &lt;unk&gt; Sound at the bottom of the &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; cliffs. The &lt;unk&gt; man crew were rescued by the &lt;unk&gt; lifeboat, the &lt;unk&gt; being awarded the &lt;unk&gt; silver medal for this rescue. Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most recent &lt;unk&gt; occurred on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor &lt;unk&gt;iking &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Alec &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions. At the request of Alec Webster, &lt;unk&gt; Station Officer, &lt;unk&gt;, a volunteer crew in a British Airways &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; helicopter from &lt;unk&gt; Airport was &lt;unk&gt;. They managed to &lt;unk&gt; all the boat &lt;unk&gt;s crew to safety within hours of the &lt;unk&gt;, despite the storm force winds. The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at &lt;unk&gt; Airport. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Economy &lt;unk&gt; Transport &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the mainstay of island life. &lt;unk&gt; form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. &lt;unk&gt; electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century. The Papa &lt;unk&gt; Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. &lt;unk&gt; now sail across the Sound of Papa to West &lt;unk&gt; on the Shetland &lt;unk&gt;. The crossing takes &lt;unk&gt; minutes, and although the &lt;unk&gt; carries cars, there is only one short road on the &lt;unk&gt; visiting &lt;unk&gt; the four main &lt;unk&gt; provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There is an airstrip which &lt;unk&gt; for regular flights from &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Culture and the arts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Papa &lt;unk&gt; sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England. A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott. The writer and journalist &lt;unk&gt;ohn Sands lived on Papa &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for a while during the late nineteenth century. The writer, &lt;unk&gt; and musician, George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa &lt;unk&gt;. It is also the &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s poem Da Sang o da Papa men, now adopted as part of the &lt;unk&gt; tradition, as set to music by &lt;unk&gt; Manson. The &lt;unk&gt; chorus chant, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt;, is particularly striking. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; da Horn o Papa, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; a hidden piece o water, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; da boat da tide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; da &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; ; We &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fish is &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; refers to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of &lt;unk&gt; were no longer visible. This entailed the boat being some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; west of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; tide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide. The &lt;unk&gt; final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the &lt;unk&gt; scent o &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; across the water. This is an example of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation. An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem &lt;unk&gt;s composition, so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life, but a noted geographical feature.  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; River &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian, New Zealand and &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces. Part of the wider &lt;unk&gt; Campaign of the Pacific theatre, the battle was fought in the southern sector of &lt;unk&gt; Island. Coming after the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll in which a strong &lt;unk&gt;apanese counterattack was defeated, the battle occurred in two distinct periods between &lt;unk&gt; April and &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, as elements of the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced south along the &lt;unk&gt; Road. The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. Following the end of the early fighting, the Australian advance towards the main &lt;unk&gt;apanese concentration at &lt;unk&gt; continued as they struck out towards the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective, &lt;unk&gt; away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies. As the Australian advance stalled, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began harassing the Australian line of communications, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and into August, the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards &lt;unk&gt; again. &lt;unk&gt;ltimately, though, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began, bringing the campaign to an end. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Strategic situation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces had landed on &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;, capturing it from the small force of Australians &lt;unk&gt; the island. They had subsequently developed several &lt;unk&gt; on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout &lt;unk&gt;, Allied planners determined that &lt;unk&gt; was vital for &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese base around Rabaul. &lt;unk&gt;S Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape &lt;unk&gt;, on the western coast of the island, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November &lt;unk&gt;. After an initial counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack, the &lt;unk&gt;S Marines had been replaced by a garrison of &lt;unk&gt;S Army troops who began consolidating their position around &lt;unk&gt;, establishing a strong perimeter. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese launched a heavy counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack, which was turned back with heavy casualties. After this, the situation on &lt;unk&gt; became largely static, as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the &lt;unk&gt;S forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around &lt;unk&gt;. In late &lt;unk&gt;, as part of plans to free &lt;unk&gt;S troops up for the Philippines campaign, the Australian II Corps &lt;unk&gt; consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took over responsibility for Allied operations on &lt;unk&gt; from the American &lt;unk&gt;I&lt;unk&gt; Corps. Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December &lt;unk&gt;, initially establishing themselves around the &lt;unk&gt;S base at &lt;unk&gt;. Due to inaccurate intelligence, &lt;unk&gt; mistakenly believed that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces on the island numbered just &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the &lt;unk&gt;apanese from &lt;unk&gt; in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the &lt;unk&gt;S forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of &lt;unk&gt;apanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of &lt;unk&gt;apanese on the island at this time was closer to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north, it was planned that &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces would be forced into the narrow &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east &lt;unk&gt; west avenues of approach, as well as &lt;unk&gt; them protection against further counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces were concentrated around &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Preliminary moves &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards &lt;unk&gt;. In late March and early April &lt;unk&gt;, they had fought the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines. Meanwhile, the survivors of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese force, heavily demoralised by their defeat, withdrew towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. The Australian &lt;unk&gt;rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south, being tasked with capturing the &lt;unk&gt; River, while the &lt;unk&gt; was also included as an &lt;unk&gt; intermediate objective &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were believed to be directly opposing the &lt;unk&gt;rd Division. The &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on &lt;unk&gt; at the time and was moved up to relieve the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade, which was in need of rest. &lt;unk&gt;nder the command of Brigadier &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, engineers from the &lt;unk&gt;th Field Company, a battery of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mm guns from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Heavy Battery, field artillery from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Field Regiment, and a number of smaller support units. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll replacing the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion while the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the &lt;unk&gt; Road. The brigade &lt;unk&gt;s third battalion &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion &lt;unk&gt; did not join them until the beginning of May, and so the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the &lt;unk&gt; River, in the &lt;unk&gt; area, until the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th could dispatch elements to relieve them. Further inland, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east, defending the brigade &lt;unk&gt;s left, or eastern, flank. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; for as long as possible, and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian &lt;unk&gt;s expected line of advance. The division &lt;unk&gt;s infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll and as a consequence, several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated. The front line positions were assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;th Field Artillery Regiment, while the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Regiment was to hold five &lt;unk&gt; to their rear along and &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; Road, designated &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; through to &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;th Field and &lt;unk&gt;th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held &lt;unk&gt; further back, designated &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; G &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear, where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Advance to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade took over the forward positions from the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade on &lt;unk&gt; April. Initial &lt;unk&gt; had the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion on the &lt;unk&gt; Road around &lt;unk&gt; Creek, with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th around &lt;unk&gt;, north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll, and the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th, when it arrived to relieve the &lt;unk&gt;th, would be positioned further east &lt;unk&gt; a secondary, parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road. Two days later, &lt;unk&gt; received the order to commence the advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, who offered him the support of the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack. In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll, from early May they advanced on a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; battalion front, instead of one. The &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was in the van, moving along the &lt;unk&gt; Road with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th protecting its flank and rear ; while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; further inland the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion, commencing on &lt;unk&gt; May, advanced along the Commando Road from &lt;unk&gt;, after taking over from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion. Moving forward under a &lt;unk&gt; barrage as they moved beyond &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the &lt;unk&gt;apanese, carrying out an attack against &lt;unk&gt;apanese positions around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Creek on &lt;unk&gt; April. &lt;unk&gt; by a troop of Matilda tanks from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, an artillery barrage which fired over &lt;unk&gt; shells, two infantry companies &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;th attacked the position while another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The left forward company &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; reached its objective without trouble ; however, &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; on the right along with the troop of tanks &lt;unk&gt; came up against stiff &lt;unk&gt;apanese resistance and became bogged down. &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the &lt;unk&gt; track. In support of &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company, &lt;unk&gt; came forward and raked the jungle, hacking through the &lt;unk&gt; to reveal several &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;, which were destroyed by the Australian armour. As night fell, &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning. Engineers were brought forward, as was a &lt;unk&gt;, and the gap was &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; heavy fighting, the Australians forced their way across the creek. By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; beyond the creek, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. After this, the Australians continued their advance towards &lt;unk&gt; Creek, which was a further &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the southeast. In response, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week, although these were turned back. During this time, the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements, one of which managed to slip through the &lt;unk&gt;apanese defensive positions either side of the &lt;unk&gt; Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the &lt;unk&gt; River about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; south of the main crossing. Further patrols were carried out, as well as a number of ambushes, before the advance was resumed on &lt;unk&gt; April. &lt;unk&gt; their advance, the Australians were supported by three squadrons of &lt;unk&gt; from the Royal New Zealand Air Force &lt;unk&gt; Nos. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons &lt;unk&gt; which bombed and &lt;unk&gt; the ground in front of the advancing infantry, as well as a &lt;unk&gt; barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the &lt;unk&gt;apanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the &lt;unk&gt;, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on &lt;unk&gt; May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade &lt;unk&gt;s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To &lt;unk&gt; the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire. Meanwhile, the previous day, &lt;unk&gt; May, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north. Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling, which resulted in them being ambushed. They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching, and crossing the river, arriving there on &lt;unk&gt; May. On &lt;unk&gt; May, along the &lt;unk&gt; Road, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again. &lt;unk&gt; with a tank troop in support, they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese. After the lead Matilda &lt;unk&gt;s machine gun jammed, the field gun opened fire on it, damaging it and wounding its crew. Moving around the stricken tank, the second Matilda, armed with a howitzer, opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the &lt;unk&gt;apanese defenders from the position. That night, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage, and the following morning put in a company &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack. The fighting lasted for over two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half hours, but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack. In doing so, they suffered one killed and nine wounded, while the attacking &lt;unk&gt;apanese had suffered heavily, losing &lt;unk&gt; men killed. It was the biggest loss since the action at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on &lt;unk&gt; May without further opposition. The previous three weeks in which they had advanced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; had been costly for them, however, with the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion losing &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Against this, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese had lost at least &lt;unk&gt; killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Crossing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the advance to the &lt;unk&gt;, there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the &lt;unk&gt; en &lt;unk&gt;. This allowed &lt;unk&gt; to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into &lt;unk&gt;apanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the &lt;unk&gt; and subsequently located a strong &lt;unk&gt;apanese position on a feature that became known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance. The main crossing was planned for &lt;unk&gt; May, with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the &lt;unk&gt; Road and the &lt;unk&gt; Track to the east of the river, while on the left the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese off the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line, crossing at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advancing straight up the &lt;unk&gt; Road. Preliminary moves began before this, and on &lt;unk&gt; May a platoon from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge. After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a &lt;unk&gt;apanese field gun, they were forced to withdraw. Meanwhile, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; squadrons &lt;unk&gt; now reinforced by No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron &lt;unk&gt; began an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day aerial campaign, attacking along the length of the &lt;unk&gt; and Commando Roads. During this period, the New Zealanders flew &lt;unk&gt; sorties, while artillery and mortars fired &lt;unk&gt; thousands of rounds &lt;unk&gt;. Two days later, on &lt;unk&gt; May, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; inland and advancing along the Commando Road with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and two batteries of artillery in support. Crossing &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; north of the &lt;unk&gt;, the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing. Nevertheless, shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out, carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on &lt;unk&gt; May. In the centre, the main attack along the &lt;unk&gt; Road began at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May after &lt;unk&gt; minutes of &lt;unk&gt; by New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; had prepared the ground. &lt;unk&gt; under a &lt;unk&gt; barrage, and with mortar and machine gun support, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve, along with two troops of Matilda tanks. &lt;unk&gt; the forward companies reached their objectives, but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded. The attack was resumed the following day, and the Australians were able to advance to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; however, they were prevented from moving any further as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese and were forced to go to ground. Finally, a company from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped. Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature. On the right flank, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. Beginning their move two days earlier, a number of patrols had had contacts with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. Meanwhile, using &lt;unk&gt; to drag the tanks through the mud, the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river, &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The following day, the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective, which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing, and further delayed by stiff resistance. Later, after one of the battalion &lt;unk&gt;s patrols came under heavy fire, the tanks moved up and attacked a &lt;unk&gt;apanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned, leaving behind a &lt;unk&gt; mm gun and a large amount of ammunition. By &lt;unk&gt; May, although there were still a number of &lt;unk&gt;apanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications, most of the Australian objectives had been secured and &lt;unk&gt; up operations began. The last remaining defensive location before the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, where the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within a short period of time the &lt;unk&gt; Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. The final phase of the battle cost the &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; killed, while the Australians lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the course of the fighting around the &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians lost &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while the &lt;unk&gt;apanese lost at least &lt;unk&gt; men killed. Following the battle, the Australians continued their advance towards &lt;unk&gt; at the southern end of the island. Throughout the remainder of the month and into &lt;unk&gt;une, the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced along the &lt;unk&gt; Road, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. Beyond the river, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply, and they consequently occupied a series of deep &lt;unk&gt;. These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade subsequently crossed &lt;unk&gt; River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade in early &lt;unk&gt;uly. As the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced toward the &lt;unk&gt; River, torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt. The height of the river rose &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Road was reduced, in the words of Gavin Long, &lt;unk&gt; to a sea of mud &lt;unk&gt; and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away. This rendered large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the &lt;unk&gt; ; meanwhile, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese continued to harass the Australians, probing their positions and setting mines and traps, targeting the Australian line of communications. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around &lt;unk&gt;, at the junction of the &lt;unk&gt; River and the &lt;unk&gt; Road, which included a heavy &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery bombardment. Australian patrols were resumed in late &lt;unk&gt;uly and continued into August. These attacks proved very costly, particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding. Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards &lt;unk&gt; continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on &lt;unk&gt; took place on the &lt;unk&gt; front in the northern sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations. Following the end of the war, the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the &lt;unk&gt; River. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, and the &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; River &lt;unk&gt;. A second battle honour &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ford &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was also awarded to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, and the &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalions for the second stage of the fighting, while the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of &lt;unk&gt; Commando Road &lt;unk&gt; for this period.  &lt;unk&gt; Calvin &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Calvin &lt;unk&gt; ( born November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a Canadian football running back for the Edmonton &lt;unk&gt; of the Canadian Football League ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He played as a &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt;, when he became the starting fullback for the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is known for being able to fill many roles at his position, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chris Schultz noting in &lt;unk&gt; that he is a &lt;unk&gt; multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; purpose running back who catches the ball extremely well, blocks well and runs well &lt;unk&gt;. He is a champion of the &lt;unk&gt; Grey Cup. Prior to being drafted by the Edmonton &lt;unk&gt; in the fourth round of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Draft, &lt;unk&gt; played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights, where he broke multiple school records. He later played college football for the Western Washington &lt;unk&gt;ikings. With the &lt;unk&gt;ikings, &lt;unk&gt; developed into a dual threat, being used heavily as a rusher and receiver. &lt;unk&gt; has spent his entire professional career with the Edmonton &lt;unk&gt;, making him the most veteran player on the team as of the &lt;unk&gt; season. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; High school career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; played high school football for the St. Thomas More Knights in &lt;unk&gt;, British Columbia beginning in &lt;unk&gt;, playing as both a running back and middle linebacker on the Grade &lt;unk&gt; team. He quickly became a key player on the team, including rushing for &lt;unk&gt; yards and four touchdowns while adding &lt;unk&gt; defensive tackles in the Grade &lt;unk&gt; provincial semi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; finals on November &lt;unk&gt; against the &lt;unk&gt; Royals. For that performance, he was named &lt;unk&gt; Star of the Week &lt;unk&gt; by The &lt;unk&gt;ancouver Sun. The Knights went on to defeat the &lt;unk&gt;ancouver College Fighting Irish &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the Grade &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; championship game, where &lt;unk&gt; scored another three touchdowns. The following year, &lt;unk&gt; joined the senior team at St. Thomas More, &lt;unk&gt; the junior team entirely. He continued in his role as a running back while switching to the secondary &lt;unk&gt;. Despite being a rare Grade &lt;unk&gt; player on the senior team, he was one of the Knights &lt;unk&gt; two leading rushers that year. &lt;unk&gt; scored a touchdown in the AAA &lt;unk&gt; championship game, helping the Knights win their first senior title as they beat the &lt;unk&gt; T &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Wolves &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. While &lt;unk&gt; Steele, the Knights &lt;unk&gt; coach, has a policy of not recording player statistics, it is estimated that &lt;unk&gt; finished &lt;unk&gt; with over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rushing yards and &lt;unk&gt; touchdowns. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; played a significant role in the Knights &lt;unk&gt; rushing and return game. He rushed for &lt;unk&gt; yards and three touchdowns against the &lt;unk&gt; Central &lt;unk&gt; in the annual &lt;unk&gt; Bowl, adding two punt returns for touchdowns. By the end of October, the Knights had compiled a perfect &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; record, and defensive coordinator and former &lt;unk&gt; defensive back Lou &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the best player for his age and talent that we &lt;unk&gt;ve ever had at our school &lt;unk&gt;. He recorded &lt;unk&gt; yards and four consecutive touchdowns with only &lt;unk&gt; carries in the Knights &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory over the W. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Hawks in the AAA championship game. For his role in earning the Knights their second AAA title, &lt;unk&gt; was named the game &lt;unk&gt;s M&lt;unk&gt;P, becoming the youngest player to earn this award. &lt;unk&gt; remained a presence on the field for the Knights in &lt;unk&gt;, expanding his role by playing some snaps as a fullback. He rushed for &lt;unk&gt; yards in that year &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Bowl, including three touchdowns as a &lt;unk&gt; and one as a fullback. &lt;unk&gt; had another notable performance in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against the South Delta Sun Devils, running for &lt;unk&gt; yards and three touchdowns. He also showed himself to be a capable receiver, including making five catches for &lt;unk&gt; yards in a match against the Holy Cross Crusaders. &lt;unk&gt; also finished that game with &lt;unk&gt; yards and two touchdowns on only three carries. Despite giving up only &lt;unk&gt; points during the entire regular season, the Knights lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the quarter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; finals of the playoffs against the Centennial &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; was stopped one yard away from the &lt;unk&gt; on the last play of the game. As a senior, &lt;unk&gt; recorded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yards and scored &lt;unk&gt; touchdowns in just nine games, averaging &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yards and over three touchdowns per game. He ran for &lt;unk&gt; yards and three touchdowns in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss against the W. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Hawks in the quarter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; finals of the AAA playoffs.

At the &lt;unk&gt; Big League World Series, &lt;unk&gt; played for Team Canada as a shortstop and center &lt;unk&gt;, helping the team to third place in the international competition. Despite being skilled as a baseball player, &lt;unk&gt; chose football over professional baseball due to the &lt;unk&gt; of the former sport. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; College career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Boise State &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; originally committed to Boise State &lt;unk&gt;niversity and played for the Broncos. In &lt;unk&gt;, he was given redshirt status and did not play. &lt;unk&gt; played a limited role the following year, but capitalized on the opportunities he was given, rushing for &lt;unk&gt; yards on only &lt;unk&gt; carries. His only touchdown came on a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yard carry in the October &lt;unk&gt; game against the Fresno State Bulldogs. The Bulldogs finished with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transferred to &lt;unk&gt; College and played for the Tigers in &lt;unk&gt;.

In the season opener, he rushed for &lt;unk&gt; yards and three touchdowns on &lt;unk&gt; carries against the Humboldt State &lt;unk&gt;. He also played a large role in the passing game early in the season, making eight receptions for &lt;unk&gt; yards through the first two games.

He saw a significantly smaller role as a receiver, catching &lt;unk&gt; passes for only &lt;unk&gt; yards. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; remained in a multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; purpose role in &lt;unk&gt; and was utilized more frequently in the passing game compared to the previous season. He made a reception for a first down following a fake punt in Week &lt;unk&gt;. He missed two games later in the season due to a hand injury. In a September &lt;unk&gt; game against the Toronto &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; rushed for &lt;unk&gt; yards on &lt;unk&gt; carries and two fourth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter touchdowns, including a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yard &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was utilized about equally on the ground and in the air, ending his season with &lt;unk&gt; rushing yards on &lt;unk&gt; carries and &lt;unk&gt; receiving yards on &lt;unk&gt; catches as well as five total touchdowns. He continued to play on the special teams where he made eight tackles. He started in six of the &lt;unk&gt; games he played, and the &lt;unk&gt; nominated him for Most Outstanding Canadian. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; utilized a committee of running backs, with &lt;unk&gt;, Daniel Porter, and &lt;unk&gt;erome &lt;unk&gt; all receiving significant playing time. &lt;unk&gt; was used mostly in short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yardage situations on the ground, while also being active as a receiver and on special teams. He played in &lt;unk&gt; games, made eight starts, and finished with &lt;unk&gt; yards on &lt;unk&gt; carries with no touchdowns.

He rushed for &lt;unk&gt; yards on &lt;unk&gt; carries, but caught &lt;unk&gt; passes for &lt;unk&gt; yards and two touchdowns. He continued to play on the special teams, and recorded nine special &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; teams tackles. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was shifted from playing mostly as a backup &lt;unk&gt; to the fullback position, where he started all &lt;unk&gt; regular season games. In his new position, &lt;unk&gt; was primarily used for blocking and remained involved on special teams and as a receiver.

After his mother, &lt;unk&gt;ackie Conway, was unable to financially support him, &lt;unk&gt; moved to Canada and lived with his father, Orlando &lt;unk&gt;. His mother was a college &lt;unk&gt; player for the &lt;unk&gt; Lady Norse, while his father was a college basketball player for the &lt;unk&gt; Warriors and the Southeastern Oklahoma State Savage Storm. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s siblings were also college athletes ; &lt;unk&gt; played &lt;unk&gt; for the McPherson Bulldogs while &lt;unk&gt;ordan was a quarterback with the &lt;unk&gt; Tigers.  &lt;unk&gt; Fort Scott National Historic Site &lt;unk&gt; Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States National Park Service in Bourbon County, Kansas, &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Named after General Winfield Scott, who achieved &lt;unk&gt; during the Mexican &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American War, during the middle of the &lt;unk&gt;th century the fort served as a military base for &lt;unk&gt;S Army action in what was the edge of settlement in &lt;unk&gt;. For the next quarter century, it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement, a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War. The current national historic site protects &lt;unk&gt; historic structures, a parade ground, and five acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of restored &lt;unk&gt; prairie, inside the city of Fort Scott. It is open to visitors most days of the year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott, was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort &lt;unk&gt; and Fort Gibson. It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers, who were migrating from the Eastern &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians, as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers &lt;unk&gt; encroachment. The &lt;unk&gt;nited States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to &lt;unk&gt; on the Indian settlements. Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt;s most active days were between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, although it was also used during the Civil War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Army days &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt; were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity. After some delay, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort &lt;unk&gt; and the site. The Army both wanted to &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense &lt;unk&gt; and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage, who had been conducting frequent raids in the area. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April &lt;unk&gt; arrived where Fort Scott would be built, in the Osage &lt;unk&gt; section of modern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Kansas. After &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; to acquire the land, the rest of Fort Wayne &lt;unk&gt;s garrison left the fort on May &lt;unk&gt; and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nlike most forts for military use, the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; parade ground. The post &lt;unk&gt;, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt;s structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two &lt;unk&gt; and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away, making transport time consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort &lt;unk&gt;s construction. As a result, only one &lt;unk&gt; of the five planned officers quarters ( four &lt;unk&gt; and post commandant &lt;unk&gt;s house &lt;unk&gt; was built by &lt;unk&gt;, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. In his &lt;unk&gt; inspection of the fort, Colonel George &lt;unk&gt; reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt; above average &lt;unk&gt;. Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American War, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army redeployed troops to the Southwest. With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By the time it was finished, it was obsolete ; three years later, it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley. For the average soldier, life at the fort was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the permanent structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. Aside from a few whiskey &lt;unk&gt; and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. Five miles East in Missouri was a &lt;unk&gt; shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; martial followed soldiers &lt;unk&gt; going &lt;unk&gt; at the shop. The &lt;unk&gt; rate from the fort ranged from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular &lt;unk&gt; ; according to Captain Swords, &lt;unk&gt; wolf chasing and duck hunting &lt;unk&gt; was the only way one officer could tolerate the place. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bleeding Kansas &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels. In &lt;unk&gt; the Kansas &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, which had kept slavery out of Kansas. &lt;unk&gt; in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery. Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Western Hotel. Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted &lt;unk&gt;, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Army returns &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a &lt;unk&gt;S military post. In August &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;nion Army took command of Fort Scott, and &lt;unk&gt; it for the war times. The &lt;unk&gt;nited States Army also took over several blocks within the town for &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; functions. The &lt;unk&gt;nion Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to &lt;unk&gt; Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Troops of the &lt;unk&gt;nion Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the &lt;unk&gt; unstable &lt;unk&gt; Indian Territory ( present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day state of Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt;, where many of the members of the Five &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a &lt;unk&gt; general hospital &lt;unk&gt; ( large military hospital &lt;unk&gt; and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;S Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the &lt;unk&gt;S Government in rights &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way, would evict them from their &lt;unk&gt; homes. The settlers considered the troops &lt;unk&gt; to the railroads, and &lt;unk&gt; both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, the buildings of the fort were left &lt;unk&gt;, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern times &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With the Act of August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott, Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort. On October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service, encompassing &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Today the fort is open throughout the year, save for &lt;unk&gt;, Christmas, and New Years Day. &lt;unk&gt; has declined in recent years. In &lt;unk&gt; visitation was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; in &lt;unk&gt; it was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Surviving structures include four officers &lt;unk&gt; barracks, one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s barracks, two infantry barracks, a hospital, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, ordnance and post headquarters, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; shop, flagpole, and magazine. Another feature of the park is &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; prairie restored as part of an ecology &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; restoration project. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a professional wrestling pay &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; per &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; view ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA &lt;unk&gt; promotion that took place on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; Civic Center in &lt;unk&gt;, Mississippi.

The &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; was the same rating given to the &lt;unk&gt; edition by Chris and Bryan &lt;unk&gt;.

The &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship contest was given a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. Wade &lt;unk&gt; of the Pro Wrestling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reviewed the show. He felt the main event had &lt;unk&gt; lots of action and drama, &lt;unk&gt; but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a &lt;unk&gt; particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; beating someone to win a fight. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a &lt;unk&gt; solid tag match &lt;unk&gt; with some &lt;unk&gt; elaborate sequences &lt;unk&gt; that were &lt;unk&gt; well executed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; stated that the &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship match was a &lt;unk&gt; very good opener. &lt;unk&gt; Regarding the &lt;unk&gt; and Angle bout, &lt;unk&gt; commented that it was a &lt;unk&gt; good match, but short of a classic must &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; see match in part because there were too many &lt;unk&gt; mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; match from Angle that took the crowd out of it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a &lt;unk&gt; slow, &lt;unk&gt; match &lt;unk&gt; with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; finish. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell stated that the &lt;unk&gt; versus Angle contest was a &lt;unk&gt; fine spotlight singles match, &lt;unk&gt; but was a &lt;unk&gt; bit &lt;unk&gt; when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA &lt;unk&gt;s best wrestlers in a featured singles match. &lt;unk&gt; He went on to say that he felt it was &lt;unk&gt; missing something &lt;unk&gt; and that it &lt;unk&gt; seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear. Caldwell felt the &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship bout was a &lt;unk&gt; very good opening match, &lt;unk&gt; which &lt;unk&gt; could have been a featured match to sell a few additional &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but TNA didn &lt;unk&gt;t give the &lt;unk&gt; Division any focus until the final show before the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell stated the World Tag Team Championship was &lt;unk&gt; just a slow, &lt;unk&gt; tag match. &lt;unk&gt; Regarding the marriage segment during the show, Caldwell said &lt;unk&gt; it was just a bad, bad, bad segment that died slowly and &lt;unk&gt; in front of the live audience. &lt;unk&gt; Overall, Caldwell felt that &lt;unk&gt; TNA showcased the &lt;unk&gt; Division in the opening match, &lt;unk&gt; but needed more &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the show to balance the slow, &lt;unk&gt; former WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After &lt;unk&gt; ended, crews began to &lt;unk&gt; the set used for the event.

Another worker named Paul Martin was also taken to the hospital due to his thumb being cut off in the incident. TNA released a statement regarding the incident the next day through their website. The &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact! was dedicated to &lt;unk&gt;, with a banner at the beginning of the show stating &lt;unk&gt; In memory Kevin &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

Despite the concerns, Angle appeared to be out of it after the contest but was expected to be &lt;unk&gt;. Samoa &lt;unk&gt;oe and Booker T started a rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship following &lt;unk&gt;. On the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that &lt;unk&gt;oe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that &lt;unk&gt;oe could not beat Booker T in a one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, &lt;unk&gt;oe announced that Booker T and he would face at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; for the title.

An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; by an unseen ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the &lt;unk&gt; passengers and four crew, &lt;unk&gt; died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the &lt;unk&gt; survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived. &lt;unk&gt; leader &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt; publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the &lt;unk&gt; in an interview with the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s Today programme the same evening, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of &lt;unk&gt;, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black &lt;unk&gt; supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing &lt;unk&gt;, were immediately suspended by the furious &lt;unk&gt;, with Smith calling &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; monster &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both &lt;unk&gt; and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA &lt;unk&gt;. The attack on &lt;unk&gt; in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. Five months later, in February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; shot down Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt;, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt; led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to &lt;unk&gt; declare independence from the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. The idea of &lt;unk&gt; no independence before majority rule &lt;unk&gt; had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s government was dominated by the country &lt;unk&gt;s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went &lt;unk&gt; internationally. Britain and the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; aligned Zimbabwe African National &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, mostly comprising &lt;unk&gt;, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA &lt;unk&gt; and adopted aspects of &lt;unk&gt; doctrine, while the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dominated Zimbabwe African People &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, aligned with Soviet &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People &lt;unk&gt;s Revolutionary Army ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the &lt;unk&gt; Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December &lt;unk&gt;, when ZANLA attacked &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency campaign during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, developments overseas caused the conflict &lt;unk&gt;s momentum to shift in the insurgents &lt;unk&gt; favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April &lt;unk&gt; caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith &lt;unk&gt;s administration, and led to Mozambique &lt;unk&gt;s independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with &lt;unk&gt;. Around the same time, Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s other main &lt;unk&gt;, South Africa, adopted a &lt;unk&gt; initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls Conference of August &lt;unk&gt;, Smith and the &lt;unk&gt; leader &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt; held unsuccessful talks between December &lt;unk&gt; and March &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; announced in October &lt;unk&gt;, during the run &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would &lt;unk&gt; attend conferences as a joint &lt;unk&gt; Patriotic Front &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Smith and non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Reverend &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Chief &lt;unk&gt;eremiah &lt;unk&gt; agreed what became the &lt;unk&gt; Internal Settlement &lt;unk&gt;. This created a joint black &lt;unk&gt; white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, pursuant to &lt;unk&gt; elections. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were invited to participate, but refused ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dubbed Smith &lt;unk&gt;s black colleagues &lt;unk&gt; the blacksmiths &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; proclaimed &lt;unk&gt; to be &lt;unk&gt; The Year of the People &lt;unk&gt; as the war continued. Officials from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nited African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas. &lt;unk&gt; also began to target Christian missionaries, &lt;unk&gt; in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at &lt;unk&gt; Mission near the Mozambican border on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control. No country recognised Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s interim administration. Smith again worked to bring &lt;unk&gt; into the government, hoping this would lend it some &lt;unk&gt; domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, he attended secret meetings with &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Zambia ( where &lt;unk&gt; was based &lt;unk&gt;, doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation &lt;unk&gt;. Attempts were made to also involve the &lt;unk&gt; leader Robert &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, negotiations between Smith and &lt;unk&gt; progressed well and &lt;unk&gt; seemed on the verge of success &lt;unk&gt; by the start of September &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, Smith and &lt;unk&gt; revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Incident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prior threats to Rhodesian air traffic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about &lt;unk&gt;, in the latter stages of the war ; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for &lt;unk&gt; was the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shoulder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; launched surface &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet &lt;unk&gt;nion from the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s as part of the Warsaw Pact &lt;unk&gt;s materiel support. By September &lt;unk&gt;, there had been &lt;unk&gt; reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia was the country &lt;unk&gt;s national airline, established by the government on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; to succeed Central African Airways, which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at Salisbury Airport, Air Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s flight network during the late &lt;unk&gt;s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of &lt;unk&gt;ohannesburg and Durban. The Flight &lt;unk&gt; aircraft was a &lt;unk&gt;ickers &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt;, a British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing. It was named the &lt;unk&gt; after the river of the same name, which flowed between Lake &lt;unk&gt; and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury. The &lt;unk&gt; was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of &lt;unk&gt;. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas on the northern side of the &lt;unk&gt; ( in Zambia &lt;unk&gt;, the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s choice tourist destinations. The flight on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, Sunday afternoon, from &lt;unk&gt; to Salisbury carried four crew members and &lt;unk&gt; passengers, most of whom were &lt;unk&gt; from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from &lt;unk&gt; Airport on schedule soon after &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Central Africa Time. Flight &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Captain &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hood, a native of &lt;unk&gt; who had gained his commercial pilot licence in &lt;unk&gt;. He had flown &lt;unk&gt; for Air Rhodesia since &lt;unk&gt;, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was &lt;unk&gt; years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; years old and from &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A group of &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas, armed with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, and fired on the &lt;unk&gt; about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seeking missile hit the plane &lt;unk&gt;s starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines &lt;unk&gt;, creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. &lt;unk&gt; wildly, the &lt;unk&gt; began to descend rapidly. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. &lt;unk&gt; We &lt;unk&gt;re going in, &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; his passengers to &lt;unk&gt; for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the &lt;unk&gt; Hills, in the bush to the west of &lt;unk&gt;, intending to belly land the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the &lt;unk&gt; hit a previously unseen ditch, &lt;unk&gt; and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks &lt;unk&gt; and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Massacre on the ground &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Of the &lt;unk&gt; people on board, &lt;unk&gt;, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil &lt;unk&gt;, led four others &lt;unk&gt; young &lt;unk&gt; Robert and Shannon &lt;unk&gt;, Mrs Sharon &lt;unk&gt;, and her four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old daughter Tracey &lt;unk&gt; off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water. The other &lt;unk&gt; remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. Three of the &lt;unk&gt; survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army &lt;unk&gt; Anthony Hill, &lt;unk&gt;, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left &lt;unk&gt; passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls ( aged &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The guerrillas, who were armed with AK &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rifles, presented themselves to the &lt;unk&gt; passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water. They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves. They told the passengers to &lt;unk&gt; around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about &lt;unk&gt; square metres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt;. Standing roughly &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; away, the cadres now raised their weapons. &lt;unk&gt; You have taken our land, &lt;unk&gt; one of them said. &lt;unk&gt; Please don &lt;unk&gt;t shoot us! &lt;unk&gt; one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire. Having collected water from the nearby village, &lt;unk&gt; and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. &lt;unk&gt; it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s group to &lt;unk&gt; come here &lt;unk&gt;. The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting &lt;unk&gt; and the others to flee. Hill and the &lt;unk&gt; also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their &lt;unk&gt;, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; around the site, filled their arms with various passengers &lt;unk&gt; belongings, then left again. The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to &lt;unk&gt; Hospital, while &lt;unk&gt; and his group were &lt;unk&gt; to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s Today radio programme the next day, laughing as he did so, to the horror of most Rhodesian observers, both black and white. He said that he had received intelligence that the &lt;unk&gt; was being used for military purposes. &lt;unk&gt; said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party &lt;unk&gt;s policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground ; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s general manager, called a &lt;unk&gt; downright, deliberate lie &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guerrillas, more specifically the mixed race &lt;unk&gt; Scouts unit, which had often been accused of &lt;unk&gt; rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. &lt;unk&gt; asserts that the massacre &lt;unk&gt; cannot be put beyond &lt;unk&gt; the Scouts, and also supports &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s claim that the &lt;unk&gt; had been used militarily, suggesting that &lt;unk&gt; might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown &lt;unk&gt; ferrying paratroopers for the job, &lt;unk&gt; he writes, &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reactions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; White &lt;unk&gt; turn against blacks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as &lt;unk&gt; a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most &lt;unk&gt; of Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; seem true. &lt;unk&gt; Indeed, the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with &lt;unk&gt;, and many turned their minds to exacting &lt;unk&gt; for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt; family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days &lt;unk&gt; investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the &lt;unk&gt; degree of anger... &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; difficult to control &lt;unk&gt;. White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the &lt;unk&gt; had raped the female passengers before &lt;unk&gt; them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of &lt;unk&gt; to anybody who would either kill &lt;unk&gt; or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial. Geoffrey &lt;unk&gt;, who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became &lt;unk&gt; and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be &lt;unk&gt; terrorist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Describing the Herald &lt;unk&gt; the night of the incident, he relates a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; collective temper &lt;unk&gt; among the white sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; editors : &lt;unk&gt; They cursed until their voices became &lt;unk&gt;, threatening dire consequences for all &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt;... I &lt;unk&gt; that some of the more derogatory remarks made in &lt;unk&gt; loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears. &lt;unk&gt; Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days. According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an &lt;unk&gt; Salisbury bar &lt;unk&gt; fingering the &lt;unk&gt; of rifles &lt;unk&gt; and forced blacks drinking there to leave. Time also reported a &lt;unk&gt; that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. Smith says that several would &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; be &lt;unk&gt; groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to &lt;unk&gt; make the local people pay for their crime of &lt;unk&gt; and assisting the terrorists &lt;unk&gt;. He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme &lt;unk&gt;, and that it would not do to attack them. Many &lt;unk&gt; also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Memorial service, &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At a memorial service held on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; for Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s passengers and crew at Salisbury &lt;unk&gt;s Anglican Cathedral, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people crowded inside, with another &lt;unk&gt; standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. &lt;unk&gt; among those present in the cathedral were &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including P K van der &lt;unk&gt;, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dean &lt;unk&gt;ohn de Costa gave a sermon &lt;unk&gt; what he described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; silence &lt;unk&gt; from overseas. &lt;unk&gt; Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but &lt;unk&gt; at the events attending the &lt;unk&gt;iscount, &lt;unk&gt; he said. &lt;unk&gt; But are we &lt;unk&gt; with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves &lt;unk&gt;? We are not! Like men in the story of the Good &lt;unk&gt;, they pass by on the other side... The &lt;unk&gt; of this ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; flight from &lt;unk&gt; will be burnt upon our memories for years to come. For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Smith &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; talks halted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The talks between Smith and the &lt;unk&gt; leader that had been progressing so &lt;unk&gt; were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; monster &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; comments that the ending of the Smith &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; talks at this time was &lt;unk&gt; potentially the most serious result of the &lt;unk&gt;iscount massacre &lt;unk&gt;, as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He &lt;unk&gt; that an agreement between the two &lt;unk&gt; at this critical stage &lt;unk&gt; might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On &lt;unk&gt; September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s intent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism &lt;unk&gt;, and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for &lt;unk&gt; any defensive strikes we might undertake &lt;unk&gt; against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the &lt;unk&gt;nited States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt; w &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; not let these &lt;unk&gt; go &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesia strikes back &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt; ; Rhodesia hits New &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Because &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were based in Zambia, many &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around &lt;unk&gt; in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November &lt;unk&gt; during Operation &lt;unk&gt;, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ground assault called Operation &lt;unk&gt;, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA &lt;unk&gt;s aid in the form of nine Soviet &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made T &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tanks and four Russian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were &lt;unk&gt; several hundred &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt; ; the &lt;unk&gt; Green Leader &lt;unk&gt; raid &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesia then attacked &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Bowyer later described as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; time &lt;unk&gt; for Flight &lt;unk&gt;. Operation &lt;unk&gt;, launched on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, was another joint &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s primary target, just &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; miles &lt;unk&gt; north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east of central &lt;unk&gt;, was the formerly white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; owned &lt;unk&gt; Farm, which had been transformed into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s main headquarters and training base under the name &lt;unk&gt; Freedom Camp &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; presumed that Rhodesia would never &lt;unk&gt; to attack a site so close to &lt;unk&gt;. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior &lt;unk&gt; staff also on site. The Rhodesian operation &lt;unk&gt;s other targets were &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; miles &lt;unk&gt; north of &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. &lt;unk&gt; targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked. &lt;unk&gt; by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to &lt;unk&gt; Airport tower as &lt;unk&gt; Green Leader &lt;unk&gt;, a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding &lt;unk&gt; radar &lt;unk&gt; and took control of the country &lt;unk&gt;s airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on &lt;unk&gt; Farm, informing &lt;unk&gt; tower that the attack was against &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia &lt;unk&gt;, and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; all of Green Leader &lt;unk&gt;s instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. &lt;unk&gt;sing &lt;unk&gt; airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors. Historians Paul &lt;unk&gt; and Peter &lt;unk&gt; write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed, as most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s army, then numbering about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been &lt;unk&gt; impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young &lt;unk&gt; recruits. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; describes Freedom Camp as &lt;unk&gt; a refugee camp for boys &lt;unk&gt;, and says &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; boys and girls &lt;unk&gt; were killed. He claims that the Red Cross and the &lt;unk&gt;N &lt;unk&gt; Agency &lt;unk&gt; confirmed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s claim that Smith &lt;unk&gt;s forces struck at &lt;unk&gt;, civilian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and &lt;unk&gt; bases did much to restore white morale following the &lt;unk&gt;iscount incident, though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; President Kenneth &lt;unk&gt; all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s rural areas, and covered three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarters of the country by the end of &lt;unk&gt;. Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shielding for its &lt;unk&gt;. Before this work was completed, &lt;unk&gt; shot down a second &lt;unk&gt;iscount, Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. This time there were no survivors. Following the second &lt;unk&gt;, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the &lt;unk&gt; would be coated with low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; radiation paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently &lt;unk&gt;. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a &lt;unk&gt;iscount so treated could not be detected by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s targeting system once it was over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. There were no further &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; in Rhodesia. In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, majority &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ruled state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December &lt;unk&gt; the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the &lt;unk&gt;K government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status. The &lt;unk&gt;K government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period. Fresh elections were won by &lt;unk&gt;, who took power in April &lt;unk&gt;, concurrently with the country &lt;unk&gt;s recognised independence as Zimbabwe. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy and memorial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In modern Zimbabwe, it is not the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; but rather the &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory. State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the Herald newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces &lt;unk&gt; and deliberately &lt;unk&gt; thousands of helpless refugees during such operations. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board. The massacre of surviving Flight &lt;unk&gt; passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than &lt;unk&gt; ; in his &lt;unk&gt; memoirs &lt;unk&gt; repeated his claim that &lt;unk&gt; fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that &lt;unk&gt; I truly have no idea how the ten died &lt;unk&gt;. A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on &lt;unk&gt; was built in Zambia in &lt;unk&gt;, and dedicated jointly by the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; governments. A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt;iscount incidents, dubbed the &lt;unk&gt;iscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the &lt;unk&gt; Monument in &lt;unk&gt;, South Africa in &lt;unk&gt;, and inaugurated on &lt;unk&gt; September that year. The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft. A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag. A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;iscount attacks and &lt;unk&gt; the victims on the anniversary of the second &lt;unk&gt; prompted &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; press, with the Herald branding it a racist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; motion &lt;unk&gt; intended to &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; administration and its supporters. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a former &lt;unk&gt; commander, described the move as a &lt;unk&gt; motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s proposed commemoration &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s official response to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s motion included the assertion that in all conflicts &lt;unk&gt; civilians get caught up in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors &lt;unk&gt;, and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; with those killed at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Newspaper and journal articles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ’ al in modern &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the ruins of an ancient city found in a &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a gum &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, reported the ruins to La &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; newspaper, which named the site &lt;unk&gt;. After the Berlin Academy of Sciences &lt;unk&gt; magazine republished the report in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and treasure hunters began visiting the forest. Today tourism to the site may help protect the &lt;unk&gt;. It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Columbian Maya civilization. It is located in the archaeological region of the &lt;unk&gt; Basin in what is now northern Guatemala. Situated in the department of El &lt;unk&gt;, the site is part of Guatemala &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; National Park and in &lt;unk&gt; it was declared a &lt;unk&gt;NESCO World Heritage Site. &lt;unk&gt; was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya. Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the &lt;unk&gt;th century BC, &lt;unk&gt; reached its &lt;unk&gt; during the Classic Period, c. &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; AD. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout &lt;unk&gt; such as the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the distant &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico. There is evidence that &lt;unk&gt; was conquered by &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at &lt;unk&gt; and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Etymology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The name &lt;unk&gt; may be derived from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The name was apparently applied to one of the site &lt;unk&gt;s ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning &lt;unk&gt; the place of the voices &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; Maya language. &lt;unk&gt;, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt; inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, meaning &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; may have come to have been called this because &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name. The kingdom as a whole was simply called &lt;unk&gt;, which is the reading of the &lt;unk&gt; hair bundle &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Location &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa &lt;unk&gt;, approximately &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; by road to the southwest. &lt;unk&gt; is approximately &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; north of Guatemala City. It is &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; south of the contemporary Maya city of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of &lt;unk&gt;. The city was located &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; southeast of its great Classic Period rival, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ally &lt;unk&gt;, now in Belize. The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; that included about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; structures. The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands. The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised &lt;unk&gt; spanning the swamps. The area around &lt;unk&gt; has been declared as the &lt;unk&gt; National Park and the preserved area covers &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the &lt;unk&gt; of lowland Maya civilization. The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils, and may have dominated a natural east &lt;unk&gt; west trade route across the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula. &lt;unk&gt; trees at the &lt;unk&gt; park include gigantic &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Honduras mahogany ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Regarding the fauna, &lt;unk&gt;, white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, gray foxes, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s spider monkeys, &lt;unk&gt; monkeys, &lt;unk&gt; eagles, falcons, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, green parrots and &lt;unk&gt; ants can be seen there regularly. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and cougars are also said to &lt;unk&gt; in the park. For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle. The average annual rainfall at &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities, &lt;unk&gt; had no water other than what was collected from &lt;unk&gt; and stored in ten reservoirs. Archaeologists working in &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt;th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use. The &lt;unk&gt; National Park covers an area of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. It was created on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; under the auspices of the &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Population &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Population estimates for &lt;unk&gt; vary from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to as high as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inhabitants, with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range. The population of &lt;unk&gt; began a continuous curve of growth starting in the &lt;unk&gt; Period ( approximately &lt;unk&gt; BC &lt;unk&gt; AD &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD &lt;unk&gt; through to &lt;unk&gt;, followed by a sharp decline. For the &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; area falling within the &lt;unk&gt; defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. In an area within a &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; population density is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. In a region within a &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a density of &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive &lt;unk&gt; that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rulers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The dynastic line of &lt;unk&gt;, founded as early as the &lt;unk&gt;st century AD, spanned &lt;unk&gt; years and included at least &lt;unk&gt; rulers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as &lt;unk&gt; BC, in the Middle &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; ceramics dating from about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; BC were found in a sealed &lt;unk&gt;, a subterranean bottle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped chamber. Major construction at &lt;unk&gt; was already taking place in the Late &lt;unk&gt; period, first appearing around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still &lt;unk&gt; by sites further north such as El &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. At this time, &lt;unk&gt; participated in the widespread &lt;unk&gt; culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time &lt;unk&gt; a region that included the entire &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize. Two temples dating to Late &lt;unk&gt; times had masonry &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; walled &lt;unk&gt; that may have been &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; vaulted, although this has not been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a &lt;unk&gt; background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red. In the &lt;unk&gt;st century AD rich burials first appeared and &lt;unk&gt; underwent a political and cultural &lt;unk&gt; as its giant northern neighbors declined. At the end of the Late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence &lt;unk&gt;, as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the &lt;unk&gt; and early murals at the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at &lt;unk&gt;. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty was founded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, perhaps in the &lt;unk&gt;rd century AD. At the beginning of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, in the core of the Maya &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; may have benefited from the collapse of the large &lt;unk&gt; states such as El &lt;unk&gt;. In the Early Classic &lt;unk&gt; rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region, &lt;unk&gt; the development of other nearby Maya cities. The site, however, was often at war and inscriptions tell of &lt;unk&gt; and conflict with other Maya states, including &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by &lt;unk&gt;, which rose to take &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands. The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between &lt;unk&gt; and its neighbor &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; recording the capture of prisoners from &lt;unk&gt;. There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD &lt;unk&gt;, when Lady &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; conducted a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending ceremony, apparently as queen of the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The fourteenth king of &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak ( Great &lt;unk&gt;aguar &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak except that he was killed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; AD. On the same day, &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ ( Fire Is Born &lt;unk&gt; arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary. On Stela &lt;unk&gt; he is named as &lt;unk&gt; Lord of the West &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Maya &lt;unk&gt; of a &lt;unk&gt; combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the distant &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; Owl may even have been the ruler of &lt;unk&gt;. These recorded events strongly suggest that &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ led a &lt;unk&gt; invasion that defeated the native &lt;unk&gt; king, who was captured and immediately executed. &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at &lt;unk&gt; itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of &lt;unk&gt; natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including &lt;unk&gt;, where he became king, but did not take the throne of &lt;unk&gt; for himself. Within a year, the son of &lt;unk&gt; Owl by the name of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I ( First Crocodile &lt;unk&gt; had been installed as the tenth king of &lt;unk&gt; while he was still a boy, being enthroned on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. He reigned for &lt;unk&gt; years as king of &lt;unk&gt;, and remained a vassal of &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I took a wife from the &lt;unk&gt;, defeated, &lt;unk&gt; dynasty and thus &lt;unk&gt; the right to rule of his son, &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a small site &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northeast of &lt;unk&gt;, was conquered by the latter during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I. The site became an outpost of &lt;unk&gt;, shielding it from hostile cities further north, and also became a trade link to the Caribbean. Although the new rulers of &lt;unk&gt; were foreign, their descendants were rapidly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; became the key ally and trading partner of &lt;unk&gt; in the Maya lowlands. After being conquered by &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; rapidly dominated the northern and eastern &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, together with smaller towns in the region, were absorbed into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s kingdom. Other sites, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; de San &lt;unk&gt;os&lt;unk&gt; near Lake &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north. By the middle of the &lt;unk&gt;th century &lt;unk&gt; had a core territory of at least &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; in every direction. Around the &lt;unk&gt;th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s hinterland, joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of &lt;unk&gt; lying to the east and west of the city. Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south. These defenses protected &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s core population and agricultural resources, &lt;unk&gt; an area of approximately &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt;th century the power of the city reached as far south as &lt;unk&gt;, whose founder K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; was clearly connected with &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the &lt;unk&gt; dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of &lt;unk&gt;. K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; arrived in &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt; and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at &lt;unk&gt;. An individual known as &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; ( lord K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is referred to in an early text at &lt;unk&gt; and may well be the same person. His tomb had &lt;unk&gt; characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; texts refer to him as &lt;unk&gt; Lord of the West &lt;unk&gt;, much like &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’. At the same time, in late &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; founded the nearby site of &lt;unk&gt;, possibly sponsored by &lt;unk&gt; itself. The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region. The interaction between these sites and &lt;unk&gt; was intense over the next three centuries. A long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running rivalry between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; began in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against each other in what has been likened to a long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running war between two Maya &lt;unk&gt;. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to &lt;unk&gt; high king &lt;unk&gt;. The early &lt;unk&gt;th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was very likely a daughter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rulers. The first of these was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;, who seems to have had a long career as a general at &lt;unk&gt; before becoming co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ruler and &lt;unk&gt;th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of &lt;unk&gt; herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord &lt;unk&gt; Bird Claw &lt;unk&gt;, who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown &lt;unk&gt;th ruler.. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Late Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hiatus &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the mid &lt;unk&gt;th century, &lt;unk&gt; seems to have allied with &lt;unk&gt; and defeated &lt;unk&gt;, closing the Early Classic. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hiatus &lt;unk&gt; refers to a period between the late &lt;unk&gt;th to late &lt;unk&gt;th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale construction at &lt;unk&gt;. In the latter half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, a serious crisis &lt;unk&gt; the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at &lt;unk&gt; was long unexplained until later &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; identified that the period was prompted by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s comprehensive defeat at the hands of &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; polity in AD &lt;unk&gt;, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of &lt;unk&gt;. The badly eroded Altar &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; described how &lt;unk&gt; suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April &lt;unk&gt;. It seems that &lt;unk&gt; was an ally of &lt;unk&gt; in the wider conflict between that city and &lt;unk&gt;, with the defeat of &lt;unk&gt; having a lasting impact upon the city. &lt;unk&gt; was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, &lt;unk&gt; grew rapidly and some of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of &lt;unk&gt; took refuge with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Palenque, another of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s victims. &lt;unk&gt; itself &lt;unk&gt; during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s long hiatus period. The beginning of the &lt;unk&gt; hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly &lt;unk&gt; the Classic period of &lt;unk&gt; chronology into the Early and Late Classic. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; founded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the southwest, as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the &lt;unk&gt; River. B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four, in &lt;unk&gt;, and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother, the king of &lt;unk&gt;. Roughly twenty years later &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was attacked by &lt;unk&gt; and was soundly defeated. B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was captured by the king of &lt;unk&gt; but, instead of being sacrificed, he was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy, and attacked &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, forcing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chaak, the then king of &lt;unk&gt;, to temporarily abandon the city. The first two rulers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued to use the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph of &lt;unk&gt;, and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of &lt;unk&gt; itself. For some reason, B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was not installed as the new ruler of &lt;unk&gt; ; instead he stayed at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, driving B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil into an exile that lasted five years. &lt;unk&gt; tried to encircle &lt;unk&gt; within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I erected the first dated monument at &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; years and claimed the title of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on &lt;unk&gt; when, in &lt;unk&gt;, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, &lt;unk&gt; never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, there was no active &lt;unk&gt; presence at any Maya site and the center of &lt;unk&gt; had been razed by &lt;unk&gt;. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was &lt;unk&gt; style. &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I and his heir &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil continued hostilities against &lt;unk&gt; and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around &lt;unk&gt;, extending as far as the territory around Lake &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, a vassal of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s key ally in the south, switched allegiance to &lt;unk&gt;, defeated &lt;unk&gt; and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of &lt;unk&gt; to bring about the collapse of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of &lt;unk&gt;. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century, the rulers of &lt;unk&gt; collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late &lt;unk&gt;th century and early &lt;unk&gt;th century, activity at &lt;unk&gt; slowed. &lt;unk&gt; architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Terminal Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations &lt;unk&gt; and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, the last of the city &lt;unk&gt;s major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The beginning of the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; passed &lt;unk&gt;, and marks the beginning of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph, with &lt;unk&gt; apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt;awiil is mentioned on a stela at &lt;unk&gt; as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of &lt;unk&gt; but he is not recorded elsewhere and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s once great power was little more than a memory. The sites of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; had by now inherited the once exclusive &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph. As &lt;unk&gt; and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered &lt;unk&gt;, erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels. &lt;unk&gt; and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from &lt;unk&gt; that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the &lt;unk&gt; region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources. In the latter half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of &lt;unk&gt;, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II in &lt;unk&gt;. This was the last monument erected at &lt;unk&gt; before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of &lt;unk&gt;, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, did not last much longer, &lt;unk&gt; their final monuments in &lt;unk&gt;. By the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th century the vast majority of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple &lt;unk&gt; dwellings were being erected in the city &lt;unk&gt;s ceremonial &lt;unk&gt;. The squatters blocked some &lt;unk&gt; in the rooms they &lt;unk&gt; in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were &lt;unk&gt; and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for &lt;unk&gt; and the easier to find tombs being looted. After &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the &lt;unk&gt;th or &lt;unk&gt;th centuries and the &lt;unk&gt; claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population may have migrated to the &lt;unk&gt; Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a &lt;unk&gt; in population levels in the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. The most likely cause of collapse at &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; and agrarian failure. The fall of &lt;unk&gt; was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having been at the forefront of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the Spanish &lt;unk&gt; Hern&lt;unk&gt;n Cort&lt;unk&gt;s passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of &lt;unk&gt; but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; became lost in the &lt;unk&gt; forests in early &lt;unk&gt; he described a ruin that may well have been &lt;unk&gt;. As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; and they guided &lt;unk&gt; expeditions to the ruins in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Some second- or third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand accounts of &lt;unk&gt; appeared in print starting in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, continuing through the writings of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lloyd Stephens in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century ( Stephens and his illustrator Frederick &lt;unk&gt; heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; travels in the region &lt;unk&gt;. Because of the site &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; from modern towns, however, no explorers visited &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, respectively the commissioner and the governor of &lt;unk&gt;, visited it in &lt;unk&gt;. Artist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in &lt;unk&gt;. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;th century ( including Alfred P. &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt;, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days &lt;unk&gt; travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From &lt;unk&gt; through &lt;unk&gt;, major archaeological excavations were carried out by the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania &lt;unk&gt; Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. &lt;unk&gt; and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Project recorded over &lt;unk&gt; monuments at the site. In &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; government began a further archeological project at &lt;unk&gt;, which continued through to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; George Lucas used &lt;unk&gt; as a filming location for the first Star Wars film, Episode I&lt;unk&gt; : A New Hope, released in &lt;unk&gt;. Temple I at &lt;unk&gt; was featured on the reverse of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park. A site museum has been built at &lt;unk&gt; ; it was completed in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Site description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been partially restored by the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala. It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas. The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high, large royal palaces, in addition to a number of smaller pyramids, palaces, residences, administrative buildings, platforms and inscribed stone monuments. There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail, originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors. There are also seven courts for playing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, including a set of &lt;unk&gt; in the Seven Temples Plaza, a unique feature in &lt;unk&gt;. The limestone used for construction was local and &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; site. The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to &lt;unk&gt; them and were used as reservoirs, together with some &lt;unk&gt; natural depressions. The main &lt;unk&gt; were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that &lt;unk&gt; rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs. The residential area of &lt;unk&gt; covers an estimated &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;, much of which has not yet been cleared, mapped, or excavated. A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. &lt;unk&gt; and Donald &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;s rings &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; metre ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; wide trench behind a rampart. The &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; ( see below &lt;unk&gt;. Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and possibly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the surrounding area. Recently, a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is &lt;unk&gt; as a defensive feature. In addition, some parts of the &lt;unk&gt; were integrated into a canal system. The &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and &lt;unk&gt; than originally thought. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the Late Classic, a network of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; linked various parts of the city, running for several kilometres through its urban core. These linked the Great Plaza with Temple &lt;unk&gt; ( located about &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; to the west &lt;unk&gt; and the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt; ( about &lt;unk&gt; kilometre ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the southeast &lt;unk&gt;. These broad &lt;unk&gt; were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams. The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northeast from Temple I&lt;unk&gt; to Group H. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs southeast from the East Plaza to Temple &lt;unk&gt;I, a distance of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs west from the Great Plaza to Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Architectural groups &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramids. On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis. The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza. The North Acropolis, together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south, is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the &lt;unk&gt; Project excavated a massive trench across the complex, thoroughly investigating its construction history. It is a complex group with construction beginning in the &lt;unk&gt; Period, around &lt;unk&gt; BC. It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD &lt;unk&gt; a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;, gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, each of them had an elaborate &lt;unk&gt; and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods. By the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, &lt;unk&gt; stelae and &lt;unk&gt; altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; &lt;unk&gt; of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the &lt;unk&gt; Period. The South Acropolis is found next to Temple &lt;unk&gt;. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt;. The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis. It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples, by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the &lt;unk&gt; period at &lt;unk&gt;. The complex was organized as a large E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history. By AD &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico, including the use of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; form. During the Early Classic period ( c. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the Mundo &lt;unk&gt; became one of the twin &lt;unk&gt; of the city, the other being the North Acropolis. From AD &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; it may have served as the royal necropolis. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it. Group G lies just south of the &lt;unk&gt; Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at &lt;unk&gt;. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of &lt;unk&gt; vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask. Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza. It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic. There are nine Twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pyramid &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;, one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east &lt;unk&gt; west axis. These pyramids are flat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; topped and have &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly &lt;unk&gt; from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine &lt;unk&gt;. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year ( or k &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to &lt;unk&gt; but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and they may reflect the extent of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s political dominance in the Late Classic. Group &lt;unk&gt; is a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex, and is one of the largest at &lt;unk&gt;. It was built by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II in &lt;unk&gt; in order to mark the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt;. Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected. Group R is another twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex, dated to &lt;unk&gt;. It is close to the Maler Causeway. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Structures &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are thousands of ancient structures at &lt;unk&gt; and only a fraction of these have been excavated, after decades of archaeological work. The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids, labelled Temples I - &lt;unk&gt;I, each of which support a temple structure on their &lt;unk&gt;. Some of these pyramids are over &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; high. They were numbered &lt;unk&gt; during the early survey of the site. It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years. Temple I ( also known as the Temple of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or Temple of the Great &lt;unk&gt;aguar &lt;unk&gt; is a funerary pyramid dedicated to &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;, who was &lt;unk&gt; in the structure in AD &lt;unk&gt;, the pyramid was completed around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The temple rises &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high. The massive &lt;unk&gt; that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives. The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania in &lt;unk&gt;. Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved and rubbed with &lt;unk&gt;, as well as &lt;unk&gt; and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink. The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the &lt;unk&gt; spanned by wooden &lt;unk&gt; fashioned from multiple beams. The outermost &lt;unk&gt; is plain but the two inner &lt;unk&gt; were carved, some of the beams were removed in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and their location is unknown, while others were taken to museums in Europe. Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask &lt;unk&gt; it was built around AD &lt;unk&gt; and stands &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high. Like other major temples at &lt;unk&gt;, the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the &lt;unk&gt; spanned by wooden &lt;unk&gt;, only the middle of which was carved. The temple was dedicated to the wife of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;, although no tomb was found. The queen &lt;unk&gt;s portrait was carved into the &lt;unk&gt; spanning the doorway of the summit shrine. One of the beams from this &lt;unk&gt; is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt;aguar Priest &lt;unk&gt; was the last of the great pyramids to be built at &lt;unk&gt;. It stood &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof &lt;unk&gt;, possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD &lt;unk&gt;. The temple shrine possesses two chambers. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is the tallest temple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid at &lt;unk&gt;, measuring &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; marks the reign of &lt;unk&gt; ’ in Chan &lt;unk&gt; ( Ruler B, the son of Ruler A or &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I &lt;unk&gt; and two carved wooden &lt;unk&gt; over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that corresponds to CE &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and as it currently stands is the tallest pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at &lt;unk&gt; may originally have been taller, as may have been one of the structures at El &lt;unk&gt;. Temple &lt;unk&gt; stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler. The temple stands &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high, making it the second tallest structure at &lt;unk&gt; - only Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is taller. The temple has been dated to about AD &lt;unk&gt;, in the Late Classic period, via &lt;unk&gt; analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Temple &lt;unk&gt;I is also known as the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt; and was dedicated in AD &lt;unk&gt;. It is notable for its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; metre ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high roof &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; comb. &lt;unk&gt; of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; comb. The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is &lt;unk&gt;. Temple &lt;unk&gt; was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway. Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall. The final version of Temple &lt;unk&gt; was completely dismantled by archaeologists in &lt;unk&gt; in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction. Structure &lt;unk&gt; is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II over the tomb of his father, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; existing twin pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry &lt;unk&gt; and three &lt;unk&gt;, the fourth ( south &lt;unk&gt; side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; platform profile, modified from the original style found at &lt;unk&gt;. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer &lt;unk&gt; with El &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; than with &lt;unk&gt; itself. The vertical &lt;unk&gt; panels are set between sloping &lt;unk&gt; panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping &lt;unk&gt; panels, related to the &lt;unk&gt;enus and star symbols used at &lt;unk&gt;. The roof of the structure was decorated with &lt;unk&gt; although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a &lt;unk&gt; tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chaak or that of his son &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I, in the later part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; possesses a clear &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; linked architectural style ; it has &lt;unk&gt;, an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fa&lt;unk&gt;ade ; it dates to the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD. It is located near to the Lost World pyramid. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a small &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style platform that dates to about AD &lt;unk&gt;. It had &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure. The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the largest structure in the Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex. It lies in the southwest portion of &lt;unk&gt; ’ s central core, south of Temple III and west of Temple &lt;unk&gt;. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late &lt;unk&gt; ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; impacted by later building activity at &lt;unk&gt;. By the end of the Late &lt;unk&gt; this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region. It attained its final form during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, in the Early Classic, standing more than &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high with &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from &lt;unk&gt; materials. Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration, the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex &lt;unk&gt; to the layout that defines the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Groups, identified as solar observatories. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; motifs. Group &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated. It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks, &lt;unk&gt; murals, relief sculptures and buildings with &lt;unk&gt; characteristics. The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis. The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III. It has two &lt;unk&gt;, with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey, which has been restored. The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows. Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III. The complex dates to AD &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Altar &lt;unk&gt; is carved with two nobles, one of whom is probably &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman. Altar &lt;unk&gt; was found in Complex N, which lies to the west of Temple III. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is sculpted with a bound captive. It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; y &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala City. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is associated with Stela &lt;unk&gt; and bears the sculpture of a bound captive. It is located in front of Temple &lt;unk&gt;I. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is carved with a captive tied to a &lt;unk&gt;. It is in the northern enclosure of Group &lt;unk&gt;, a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is a plain monument associated with Stela &lt;unk&gt;. The stela &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; altar pair is &lt;unk&gt; located at the base of the stairway of Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At &lt;unk&gt;, beams of &lt;unk&gt; wood were placed as &lt;unk&gt; spanning the inner &lt;unk&gt; of temples. These are the most elaborately carved wooden &lt;unk&gt; to have survived anywhere in the Maya region. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Temple I&lt;unk&gt; was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. It was in almost perfect condition and depicts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil seated on a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stelae &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stelae are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at &lt;unk&gt; follows : Stela &lt;unk&gt; dates to the &lt;unk&gt;th century and depicts the king &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II in a standing position. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is dated to AD &lt;unk&gt;, during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after the intrusion of &lt;unk&gt; in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and &lt;unk&gt; qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;aguar God under one arm and the Mexican &lt;unk&gt; under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the &lt;unk&gt; War &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a badly damaged monument dating to &lt;unk&gt; and bears the name of the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; who celebrated the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt; in that year. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is twinned with Stela &lt;unk&gt; but is badly damaged. It described the accession of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century and earlier events in his career, including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was the last monument ever erected at &lt;unk&gt; ; it was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is linked to the queen known as the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and king &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;. The queen is described as performing the year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt;, during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. The sculpture, including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text, are limited to the front face of the monument. It was found in Complex N, west of Temple III. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was one of two stelae erected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I to celebrate the k &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending of AD &lt;unk&gt;. It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected at the base of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, his funerary shrine. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was found in Complex P, in Group H, and was moved to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; y &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala City. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil. Only the bottom of the stela is intact, the rest having been &lt;unk&gt; in ancient times. The surviving sculpture is of fine quality, consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text. The stela is associated with Altar &lt;unk&gt; and is located in front of Temple &lt;unk&gt;I. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II in the northern enclosure of Group &lt;unk&gt;, a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex. The face of the figure on the stela has been &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was broken in antiquity and was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected in a residential complex. The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a daughter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right, being paired with male co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rulers. It dates to the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was erected at the foot of Temple &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, accompanied by Altar &lt;unk&gt;. Both were broken into fragments in ancient times, although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was found in the summit shrine of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, underneath a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine. Stela &lt;unk&gt; bears a Long Count ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; date equivalent to AD &lt;unk&gt;, the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding the head of an underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the &lt;unk&gt;th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archaeologists in &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography is similar to that of &lt;unk&gt;, one of the more important of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s enemies. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is the accession monument of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II, also bearing two portraits of his father, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as a youth dressed as a &lt;unk&gt; warrior. He carries a &lt;unk&gt; in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; buried. Stela &lt;unk&gt; has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at &lt;unk&gt;. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at El Peru and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. It was also the first stela at &lt;unk&gt; to be carved on all four faces. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a fragmented monument with a foreign &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god &lt;unk&gt;, including his &lt;unk&gt; eyes and &lt;unk&gt; headdress. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is &lt;unk&gt; the figure of a bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD &lt;unk&gt;. The text on the back of the monument describes a &lt;unk&gt; ritual to celebrate a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending. The stela also names &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak I &lt;unk&gt;s father as K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; bears a portrait of Kan &lt;unk&gt; and dates to AD &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is paired with Altar &lt;unk&gt;. It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb, with the handle formed from three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional body painted on the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It is located beneath Structure &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. The tomb contained a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also &lt;unk&gt; with the deceased king. &lt;unk&gt; in the tomb were &lt;unk&gt; and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and &lt;unk&gt; styles. Among the offerings was an incense &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the shape of an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a &lt;unk&gt; vault, then the pyramid was built on top. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is generally accepted as the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;. It is located beneath Temple &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two &lt;unk&gt; who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king &lt;unk&gt;s skeleton was missing its skull, its &lt;unk&gt; and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dates to the Late &lt;unk&gt; and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive &lt;unk&gt; vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its &lt;unk&gt;. The dynastic founder of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being &lt;unk&gt; by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small &lt;unk&gt; mask with shell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; teeth and eyes and bearing a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pointed royal &lt;unk&gt;. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare &lt;unk&gt; lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a &lt;unk&gt; shell and twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; six ceramic vessels. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, below the level of the Great Plaza. The tomb contained rich offerings of &lt;unk&gt;, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of &lt;unk&gt; ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate &lt;unk&gt; mosaic vessel with the &lt;unk&gt; bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was flooded with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely &lt;unk&gt; away by the time the tomb was excavated, leaving &lt;unk&gt; in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these &lt;unk&gt; with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K &lt;unk&gt;awiil, the wooden originals long gone. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a &lt;unk&gt; mosaic vessel topped with the head of the &lt;unk&gt; God.  &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog ( &lt;unk&gt; video game &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. The game was first released in North America, Europe and Australia in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;apan the following month. The game features an anthropomorphic &lt;unk&gt; named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. &lt;unk&gt;, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;s gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. The game &lt;unk&gt;s development began in &lt;unk&gt;, when Sega ordered its &lt;unk&gt; development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue &lt;unk&gt; with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves &lt;unk&gt; Sonic Team &lt;unk&gt; to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by the game &lt;unk&gt;s programmer, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The game was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, music, and speed of gameplay. The game was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super &lt;unk&gt; console. It has been ported a number of times, and inspired several &lt;unk&gt;, a successful franchise, and adaptations by other media. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In an attempt to steal the six Chaos &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; their power, the game &lt;unk&gt;s antagonist, Dr. Ivo &lt;unk&gt;, has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the &lt;unk&gt; himself. If the player collects all the Chaos &lt;unk&gt; and completes the game, a reward ending sequence is shown. If all the &lt;unk&gt; are not collected, &lt;unk&gt; taunts the player while &lt;unk&gt; the Chaos &lt;unk&gt; instead. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gameplay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog is a &lt;unk&gt;D, side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loops. The levels contain &lt;unk&gt; in the form of robots ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the Western game manuals &lt;unk&gt; inside of which Dr. &lt;unk&gt; has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into &lt;unk&gt; pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s main attack is his spin, where he &lt;unk&gt; into a ball and &lt;unk&gt; rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles &lt;unk&gt;. This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. &lt;unk&gt; around each level map are gold rings, and collecting &lt;unk&gt; rings rewards the player with an extra life. &lt;unk&gt; are a layer of protection against &lt;unk&gt; ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he &lt;unk&gt; with an enemy ( or obstacle &lt;unk&gt;, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered ; they will &lt;unk&gt; and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary &lt;unk&gt; may be collected to provide additional protection, certain &lt;unk&gt; ( such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a &lt;unk&gt; pit or running out of time &lt;unk&gt; will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill, &lt;unk&gt;, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and &lt;unk&gt; Brain &lt;unk&gt;, each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts &lt;unk&gt; to progress. At the end of each zone &lt;unk&gt;s third act, the player confronts Dr. &lt;unk&gt; ( who pilots a different vehicle each time &lt;unk&gt; in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with &lt;unk&gt;. The player begins with three lives ( power &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ups and rings add more &lt;unk&gt;, which are lost when Sonic &lt;unk&gt; with hazardous enemies ( or objects &lt;unk&gt; without rings, falls off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen or exceeds an act &lt;unk&gt;s ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minute time limit. &lt;unk&gt; acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the &lt;unk&gt; will reset to &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; when he returns to the &lt;unk&gt;. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues &lt;unk&gt;. When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a &lt;unk&gt; Secret Zone &lt;unk&gt; in the original Genesis manual &lt;unk&gt;. In each of six Special &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt; off the &lt;unk&gt; and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each &lt;unk&gt; rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a &lt;unk&gt; goal block &lt;unk&gt; ( which ends the level &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Development &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and character design &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Sega ordered its in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; house development studio, &lt;unk&gt;, to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. This was a position already held by the character Alex &lt;unk&gt;, but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse. Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot, Mario, in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time, particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. &lt;unk&gt;, and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry. Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles, it knew this would not be enough. &lt;unk&gt; developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Development emphasized speed, so &lt;unk&gt; eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals, as well as fast creatures like &lt;unk&gt; and squirrels. One idea, a &lt;unk&gt; able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball, their idea for an attacking move. &lt;unk&gt; then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough, so they focused on two animals with spikes : &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; character, first proposed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, prevailed, although the &lt;unk&gt; would later become the basis for Mighty the &lt;unk&gt; ( who first appeared in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; has admitted since that he created Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s basic design by combining Felix the Cat &lt;unk&gt;s head with Mickey Mouse &lt;unk&gt;s body. Sonic was originally &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; colored, then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo. His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt;s boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus, whom &lt;unk&gt; saw as the most &lt;unk&gt; famous character in the world &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s spikes were emphasized to make him look &lt;unk&gt;, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button &lt;unk&gt;. The new character was originally named &lt;unk&gt; Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but the eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; member &lt;unk&gt; changed his name to &lt;unk&gt; Sonic &lt;unk&gt; and their studios to Sonic Team. &lt;unk&gt; proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a &lt;unk&gt; is and initially proposed a full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes. The antagonist ended up being named &lt;unk&gt; Dr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan and &lt;unk&gt; Dr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega &lt;unk&gt;s American and &lt;unk&gt;apanese divisions. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Programming and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to esteemed programmer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who had impressed them through his work on &lt;unk&gt; Star and the Genesis port of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; n &lt;unk&gt;. The gameplay originated with a tech demo by &lt;unk&gt;, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s prototype was a platform game with a fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was &lt;unk&gt; out with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s character designs and levels by designer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was &lt;unk&gt; in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The game &lt;unk&gt;s color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist &lt;unk&gt; Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California. In designing the game mechanics, &lt;unk&gt; was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. &lt;unk&gt; the simplicity of Miyamoto &lt;unk&gt;s mechanics in complex environments, &lt;unk&gt; decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly. Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis &lt;unk&gt; technological prowess, the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign, a process taking over six months. The developers &lt;unk&gt; efforts were rewarded ; according to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the game had the fastest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console. The team intended to add a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; player mode displayed via split &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen, but &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature. However, such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, where the second player would control Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s best friend Miles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; worked &lt;unk&gt; hours a day on the project for several months. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s relationship with Sega of &lt;unk&gt;apan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game. He left the company shortly after the game &lt;unk&gt;s release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega of &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the game &lt;unk&gt;s code. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato &lt;unk&gt;, bassist and lead songwriter of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pop band Dreams Come True. The game uses &lt;unk&gt; Yamaha &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; programmable sound generators to produce a variety of &lt;unk&gt; sound effects and music. It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic &lt;unk&gt; to the music of a &lt;unk&gt; Sonic Band &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on guitar, Max Monkey on bass, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on drums, and &lt;unk&gt; the Crocodile on keyboard. The playable &lt;unk&gt; became a recurring character in the series, also appearing in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Heroes, and Sonic Free &lt;unk&gt;. The development schedule scrapped the feature, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced the test with the &lt;unk&gt; Se &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; chant used in T&lt;unk&gt; commercials ( which reportedly used one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eighth of the memory of the four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cartridge &lt;unk&gt;. On October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, twenty years after the game &lt;unk&gt;s release, a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; was released in &lt;unk&gt;apan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Masato &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their &lt;unk&gt; remixes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Game &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; package illustrator Akira &lt;unk&gt; said that his goal was to make the characters &lt;unk&gt; colorful &lt;unk&gt;, using clear lines and &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; finish them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt;, the developers asked him to create a package design &lt;unk&gt; similar to pop art... without being particular to conventional packages &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; something &lt;unk&gt; original &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; stylish &lt;unk&gt;. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;apan on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing &lt;unk&gt; Beast. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; versions and ports &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in &lt;unk&gt; for Sega &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit consoles, the Master System and Game &lt;unk&gt;. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version, with different level themes and digital assets. The level design is &lt;unk&gt;, with no vertical loops, and Sonic cannot re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; collect his rings after being hit. The game has a different soundtrack, composed by &lt;unk&gt; musician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and including his compositions and adaptations of music from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version. It was the final game released for the Master System in North America. The Master System version was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; released for Wii &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; service in North America on August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and in Europe on August &lt;unk&gt;. The Game &lt;unk&gt; version was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; released for the Nintendo &lt;unk&gt;DS &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and included as an &lt;unk&gt; game in Sonic Adventure &lt;unk&gt; : Director &lt;unk&gt;s Cut for &lt;unk&gt; and Windows and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;box, and Windows. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A port, Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was released for the Game Boy Advance ( GBA &lt;unk&gt; on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;nited States to mark the game &lt;unk&gt;s fifteenth anniversary. It included several new features, such as the ability to save game progress, a level select option, and an &lt;unk&gt; Mode with the Spin &lt;unk&gt; move ( not originally implemented until Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Its screen is slightly &lt;unk&gt; in, and adapted to the GBA &lt;unk&gt;s widescreen aspect ratio. The game received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of &lt;unk&gt; percent ; the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance ( resulting in a slow frame rate &lt;unk&gt;, remixed &lt;unk&gt; music, and poor preservation of the original gameplay. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Compilation releases &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With its sequels for the Genesis, Sonic the Hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers. It has appeared in Sonic Compilation ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Genesis, Sonic &lt;unk&gt;am ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Sega Saturn and &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Mega Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Mega Collection Plus ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;ltimate Genesis Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt;box &lt;unk&gt; and PlayStation &lt;unk&gt;, and Sonic Classic Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Nintendo DS. Additionally, the game is an &lt;unk&gt; reward in the console versions of Sonic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Downloadable releases &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog has been available for all three major seventh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generation video game consoles. It was part of the Wii &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; at the service &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; introduction, and was released for the &lt;unk&gt;box Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for the &lt;unk&gt; Classic, &lt;unk&gt; video, and video &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; capable &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; models in &lt;unk&gt; and for Apple &lt;unk&gt;s iOS service ( compatible &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; touch models &lt;unk&gt; in April &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic the Hedgehog became available on &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;. In October &lt;unk&gt;, it was released as a Microsoft Windows download which was ported to Steam. The game was ported to two online &lt;unk&gt; services ( Google Play and the Amazon &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt;. A remastered mobile port, created using Christian Whitehead &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Engine previously used in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Sonic CD, was released on iOS, replacing the original port, on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with an &lt;unk&gt; version released the following day. The port features widescreen graphics, the optional ability to spin dash, a time attack mode, and the &lt;unk&gt; option to play as &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;. The game was also released as part of the Nintendo &lt;unk&gt;DS &lt;unk&gt;D Classics line in May &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan, and worldwide in December. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews, with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews. The game rivaled the Mario series, particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System &lt;unk&gt;. Paul Rand of Computer and &lt;unk&gt;ideo Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more &lt;unk&gt; depth of play &lt;unk&gt;. Reviewers noted the game &lt;unk&gt;s colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme &lt;unk&gt; lively, but never &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds &lt;unk&gt; eye &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; popping &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; gorgeous &lt;unk&gt;, which was echoed by Mean Machines. According to the &lt;unk&gt; ( Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk &lt;unk&gt; of Dragon, &lt;unk&gt; The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; called the animation &lt;unk&gt; some of the &lt;unk&gt; and fastest... ever seen &lt;unk&gt;. The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them &lt;unk&gt; great &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; amazing &lt;unk&gt;. Rand noted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of catchy tunes and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, calling some of the sound effects &lt;unk&gt; absolutely brilliant &lt;unk&gt;. Although Mean Machines called the songs &lt;unk&gt; vaguely appealing &lt;unk&gt;, the game &lt;unk&gt;s sound effects were better appreciated. Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in &lt;unk&gt;. GamePro &lt;unk&gt;s Boogie Man noted its &lt;unk&gt; lightning &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fast action &lt;unk&gt; and, according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; If you thought the Enterprise was quick, wait till you see Sonic at &lt;unk&gt; speed. &lt;unk&gt; The game &lt;unk&gt;s difficulty was disputed, described as &lt;unk&gt; impossible &lt;unk&gt; by Rand and &lt;unk&gt; average &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. Rand said about the gameplay in general that it &lt;unk&gt; plays like a dream &lt;unk&gt; ; according to &lt;unk&gt; it would &lt;unk&gt; players for hours, and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team &lt;unk&gt;s ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping. Although &lt;unk&gt;, Dragon, and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms &lt;unk&gt;, Paul found losing all of one &lt;unk&gt;s rings frustrating. Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity, appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time. Frank &lt;unk&gt; of GameSpot described the game as &lt;unk&gt; one of the best &lt;unk&gt; of all time &lt;unk&gt;, noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port &lt;unk&gt; after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up &lt;unk&gt;. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : &lt;unk&gt; You &lt;unk&gt;ll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s graphics engine, which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game &lt;unk&gt;s known for. But the technical achievement impressed back in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and still does so today. &lt;unk&gt; Mega ranked the game its third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; favorite Genesis title, and in &lt;unk&gt; Game Informer called it the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over &lt;unk&gt; million copies by February &lt;unk&gt;, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the industry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Primarily because of its Genesis &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console &lt;unk&gt;s North American popularity. During October &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the Genesis &lt;unk&gt; the Super &lt;unk&gt; by a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; one ratio, and at its &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; peak claimed &lt;unk&gt; percent of the market for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, this was the first time since December &lt;unk&gt; that the company did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and momentum &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based physics to the standard platform formula. Set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pieces and mechanics introduced by the game ( such as loops, springs, and acceleration pads &lt;unk&gt; have appeared in other games and become associated with the Sonic series. A flood of &lt;unk&gt; animal with attitude &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, each featuring a cartoon mascot, were released after Sonic the Hedgehog : &lt;unk&gt;, Aero the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Bat, &lt;unk&gt;ames Pond &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;im, Zero the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the Tasmanian Tiger, &lt;unk&gt;. This carried into the PlayStation era with games like &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Crash Bandicoot. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and other media &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The game &lt;unk&gt;s success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise. A &lt;unk&gt; sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;, gave Sonic a best friend ( and sidekick &lt;unk&gt; named Miles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and continued the fight against Dr. &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the &lt;unk&gt;. The series has ventured from &lt;unk&gt; to fighting, racing, role &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; playing, and sports games, and has expanded into anime and manga, cartoons and comic books, novels, and toys. Sonic the Hedgehog has become one of the best &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; selling video game franchises of all time, with over &lt;unk&gt; million copies sold by May &lt;unk&gt;. The game &lt;unk&gt;s first stage, Green Hill Zone, has also been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for use in several other titles such as Sonic Adventure &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt; and the Super Smash Bros. series.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. C. W. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was the &lt;unk&gt;th Governor of Kentucky and a &lt;unk&gt;nited States Senator from Kentucky. He was the state &lt;unk&gt;s first popularly elected senator following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment. &lt;unk&gt; from a prominent political family, &lt;unk&gt; was chosen as Democrat William &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s running mate in the gubernatorial election of &lt;unk&gt; despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so. &lt;unk&gt; lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot &lt;unk&gt;. A day later the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt; enough votes to give the election to &lt;unk&gt;, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and &lt;unk&gt; over the governorship. &lt;unk&gt; ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Following his term as governor, &lt;unk&gt; made a bid to become a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senator. His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley. Six years later &lt;unk&gt; secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; election bid largely because of his pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; temperance views and his opposition to women &lt;unk&gt;s suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt; campaign in &lt;unk&gt;. He died in Louisville on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. C. W. &lt;unk&gt; was born at &lt;unk&gt;, near &lt;unk&gt; in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of William &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. His maternal grandfather, Charles A. &lt;unk&gt;, was governor of Kentucky from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and served as &lt;unk&gt; general in the administration of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Tyler. His uncle, Robert C. &lt;unk&gt;, served as governor of Louisiana. &lt;unk&gt; obtained his early education at &lt;unk&gt; Academy in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of &lt;unk&gt;. Later, he enrolled at Central &lt;unk&gt;niversity ( now Eastern Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt; in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of &lt;unk&gt; to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of &lt;unk&gt; public schools, serving from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, he studied law at the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in &lt;unk&gt;. He was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. He also served as president of the Young Democrats &lt;unk&gt; Club of Nelson County. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Political career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s political career began in &lt;unk&gt; when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms and was Speaker of the House in &lt;unk&gt;, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Governor of Kentucky &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Democrat William &lt;unk&gt; chose &lt;unk&gt; as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate. But friends of &lt;unk&gt; assured him that &lt;unk&gt; would be loyal to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s reform agenda, whereas the two other men &lt;unk&gt; was considering as running mates would &lt;unk&gt; stack the Senate committees against him. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was not yet &lt;unk&gt;, the minimum age to serve as governor, at the time of his selection. &lt;unk&gt; lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt;s session opened on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the election results were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, when &lt;unk&gt; was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building. The following day, as &lt;unk&gt; was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt; enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later &lt;unk&gt; died, never having risen from the bed. Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly &lt;unk&gt;s decision and &lt;unk&gt; the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature &lt;unk&gt; Taylor &lt;unk&gt;s orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Taylor and &lt;unk&gt; agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of &lt;unk&gt;. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, at that time the court of last resort in the state. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, which declined to hear the case on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Taylor &lt;unk&gt;s only supporter on the court was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Marshall &lt;unk&gt;. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing he would be implicated in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assassination. &lt;unk&gt; became acting governor, but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election, a special election was held November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, to determine who would complete &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; term. &lt;unk&gt; ( now of age &lt;unk&gt; won the election over Republican &lt;unk&gt;ohn W. &lt;unk&gt; by fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. Shortly following the special election, &lt;unk&gt; married &lt;unk&gt;ean Raphael &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. The couple had two sons. As governor &lt;unk&gt; sought to unite his party and the state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the &lt;unk&gt; partisan &lt;unk&gt; Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly. He stressed non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state &lt;unk&gt;s educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and &lt;unk&gt; had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state &lt;unk&gt;s revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under &lt;unk&gt; to work without their parents &lt;unk&gt; consent. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, &lt;unk&gt; announced he would seek a full term as governor in &lt;unk&gt;. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled &lt;unk&gt; had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. &lt;unk&gt;, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. &lt;unk&gt; defeated &lt;unk&gt; and three minor candidates. In his message to the legislature in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the &lt;unk&gt; session. During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; signed the Day Law &lt;unk&gt; racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky. &lt;unk&gt; College, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the &lt;unk&gt;s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. &lt;unk&gt; appealed to the Supreme Court, and in &lt;unk&gt; the court handed down an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; decision against the college. Only &lt;unk&gt;ohn Marshall &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Near the close of the &lt;unk&gt; session, legislators approved the creation of &lt;unk&gt; County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon the county &lt;unk&gt;s existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the &lt;unk&gt; square miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than &lt;unk&gt; square miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of &lt;unk&gt; County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and &lt;unk&gt;, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of a county seat. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the &lt;unk&gt; and dissolved &lt;unk&gt; County. During the &lt;unk&gt; legislative session, &lt;unk&gt; urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred &lt;unk&gt;, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, &lt;unk&gt; the its economy and providing &lt;unk&gt; some protection against fraud. &lt;unk&gt; refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black &lt;unk&gt; Tobacco Wars. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably his reasons were political &lt;unk&gt; the Democrats were dominant in this region and he didn &lt;unk&gt;t want to challenge his own party. By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government, &lt;unk&gt; virtually eliminated the state &lt;unk&gt;s debt. Encouraged by the state &lt;unk&gt;s improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state &lt;unk&gt;s normal schools, Western State Teachers College in &lt;unk&gt; Green ( later Western Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt; and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt;. With a successful legislative session behind him, &lt;unk&gt; made a bold political move in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and &lt;unk&gt; primaries in November &lt;unk&gt; a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the &lt;unk&gt; election. &lt;unk&gt; wanted the Senate seat, and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination while he was still governor. It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party &lt;unk&gt;s choice of his potential successor as governor. State &lt;unk&gt; Samuel Wilbur &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s choice for governor and easily won the early primary over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Former governor &lt;unk&gt;ames B. &lt;unk&gt; challenged &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; nomination, but &lt;unk&gt; won by more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senator &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s term as governor ended December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot &lt;unk&gt; secured &lt;unk&gt; of the needed &lt;unk&gt; votes ; Bradley received &lt;unk&gt; votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for &lt;unk&gt;. Over the next six weeks, &lt;unk&gt; more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority, even though William &lt;unk&gt;ennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for &lt;unk&gt;. Some Democrats pressured &lt;unk&gt; to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the &lt;unk&gt;th ballot, taken near the end of February &lt;unk&gt;, Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election. His position put him at odds with Henry &lt;unk&gt;, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournal. As governor &lt;unk&gt; had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals &lt;unk&gt; the results of Louisville &lt;unk&gt;s municipal elections due to interference by the city &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; whiskey ring &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; appointed Robert Worth &lt;unk&gt;, a young lawyer and fellow &lt;unk&gt;, as interim mayor until elections could be held in November. &lt;unk&gt; eliminated &lt;unk&gt; in the police department, closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday. Following this, the whiskey ring announced &lt;unk&gt; had forfeited the support of Louisville &lt;unk&gt;s legislators. In the &lt;unk&gt; election in &lt;unk&gt;, three of the four Democrats who voted against &lt;unk&gt; were from Louisville. Following his defeat, &lt;unk&gt; returned to his law practice. Six years later &lt;unk&gt; again attempted to win the Senate seat. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, the senator would not be elected by the legislature, but by popular vote. In the Democratic primary &lt;unk&gt; defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year veteran congressman. The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; by his support of President &lt;unk&gt; Wilson, &lt;unk&gt; won the election by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; served as chairman of the Senate Committee on &lt;unk&gt; in the Department of Labor from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky, Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt;nited States entered World War I, &lt;unk&gt; continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations. True to his &lt;unk&gt; stance, &lt;unk&gt; supported passage of the &lt;unk&gt; Amendment &lt;unk&gt; the import and sale of alcohol in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics, &lt;unk&gt; opposed the &lt;unk&gt; Amendment, which granted women &lt;unk&gt;s suffrage. The amendment failed on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, but passed on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; voted against it both times. The Democrats &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; without opposition in &lt;unk&gt;. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the &lt;unk&gt; industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas where these industries were prominent &lt;unk&gt; received more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee &lt;unk&gt;ames M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women &lt;unk&gt;s vote and by his support of President Wilson, who had lost popularity since &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s election in &lt;unk&gt;. Ernst won the election by fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes, winning the race with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent of the vote to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent. During his single term in the Senate &lt;unk&gt; served alongside three other &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senators from Kentucky : &lt;unk&gt; M. &lt;unk&gt;ames, George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later life and death &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following his term in the Senate, &lt;unk&gt; resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in &lt;unk&gt;. This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. &lt;unk&gt;. He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the &lt;unk&gt; Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow &lt;unk&gt; betting at the state &lt;unk&gt;s horse &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Club ran a candidate in both parties &lt;unk&gt; primary elections. In the Democratic primary &lt;unk&gt; defeated the Club &lt;unk&gt;s relatively obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. &lt;unk&gt; D. Sampson, the Club &lt;unk&gt;s nominee in the Republican primary, won his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination. In the general election &lt;unk&gt; could not secure the support of Democratic governor William &lt;unk&gt;. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the &lt;unk&gt; Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, &lt;unk&gt; lost to Sampson by more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. It was estimated that the Club spent over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to defeat him. &lt;unk&gt; was expected to be the Democrats &lt;unk&gt; nominee for governor in &lt;unk&gt;, but the death of his son in late &lt;unk&gt; left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. &lt;unk&gt; Happy &lt;unk&gt; Chandler of Henderson, who won the election. &lt;unk&gt; supported Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s bid, and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government &lt;unk&gt; Commission. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to return to the Senate in &lt;unk&gt;. The head of the &lt;unk&gt; Club, &lt;unk&gt;ames B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ally, Robert &lt;unk&gt;, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt;s, increasing his prominence and influence. &lt;unk&gt; also enjoyed the support of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, though, by the entry of &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; Brown, a Democrat who was a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to &lt;unk&gt;, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of &lt;unk&gt; and Chandler, he did garner &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes, most of them at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; died in Louisville on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. &lt;unk&gt; County, Oklahoma, was named in his honor at the suggestion of a &lt;unk&gt; who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt;s constitutional convention in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, his birthplace, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Military history of Australia &lt;unk&gt; The military history of Australia spans the nation &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year modern history, from the early Australian frontier wars between &lt;unk&gt; and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early &lt;unk&gt;st century. Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations, Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars, and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity, including the Anzac spirit. The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma. As British &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian colonies participated in Britain &lt;unk&gt;s small wars of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, while later as a &lt;unk&gt; dominion, and then an independent nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, as well as in the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and &lt;unk&gt;ietnam during the Cold War. In the Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, through the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians died during the course of these conflicts. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; War and Australian society &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an &lt;unk&gt; conception of the Australian experience of war and of &lt;unk&gt;, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity. The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : &lt;unk&gt; with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the &lt;unk&gt;apanese crisis of &lt;unk&gt;, while since then an alliance with the &lt;unk&gt;nited States has &lt;unk&gt; its security. &lt;unk&gt;, this pattern of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more &lt;unk&gt; security concerns &lt;unk&gt; has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic &lt;unk&gt; has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to &lt;unk&gt; resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in &lt;unk&gt; for major military challenges. Reflecting both the realist and liberal &lt;unk&gt; of international relations and the conception of national interests, a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the &lt;unk&gt; of notions of &lt;unk&gt; sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a &lt;unk&gt; of security, and the proposition that the status &lt;unk&gt; in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, &lt;unk&gt;, collective security and defence self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic &lt;unk&gt; have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society &lt;unk&gt;s democratic political tradition and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Christian Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These &lt;unk&gt; are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pacific, and the &lt;unk&gt; circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers &lt;unk&gt; known colloquially as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have often been noted, somewhat &lt;unk&gt;, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Colonial era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British Forces in Australia, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt; the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in &lt;unk&gt; by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in &lt;unk&gt;. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in &lt;unk&gt;. As a result, in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;rd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever &lt;unk&gt;. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating &lt;unk&gt;, putting down convict rebellions &lt;unk&gt; as occurred at Bathurst in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian &lt;unk&gt;. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station, based in Sydney. However, in &lt;unk&gt; Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a &lt;unk&gt;, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until &lt;unk&gt;, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy &lt;unk&gt;s depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Frontier warfare, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settler &lt;unk&gt;s presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants &lt;unk&gt; lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the &lt;unk&gt; approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many &lt;unk&gt; served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between &lt;unk&gt; and Europeans was localised as the &lt;unk&gt; did not form &lt;unk&gt; capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. &lt;unk&gt; or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and continuing into the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. This warfare &lt;unk&gt; the popular and at times academic &lt;unk&gt; myth &lt;unk&gt; of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; in Western Australia in &lt;unk&gt;. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the &lt;unk&gt; Creek massacre in New South Wales in &lt;unk&gt; seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called Black War was fought between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and aimed at driving most of the island &lt;unk&gt;s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly &lt;unk&gt; by Europeans on &lt;unk&gt;. Although many more &lt;unk&gt; died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; existing hunting and fighting practices &lt;unk&gt; using &lt;unk&gt;, clubs and other primitive weapons. &lt;unk&gt;nlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main &lt;unk&gt; failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The &lt;unk&gt; were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of &lt;unk&gt; attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the &lt;unk&gt; would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their &lt;unk&gt; while the settlers &lt;unk&gt;. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the &lt;unk&gt; than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms. However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to the late &lt;unk&gt;th century, firearms were often &lt;unk&gt; muzzle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loading, smooth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bore, single shot &lt;unk&gt; with flint &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. These deficiencies may have initially given the &lt;unk&gt; an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with &lt;unk&gt; or clubs. Yet by &lt;unk&gt; significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage, with the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shot &lt;unk&gt; revolver, the &lt;unk&gt; single shot breech &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loading rifle and later the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Henry rifle, as well as rapid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle, becoming available. These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of &lt;unk&gt;, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; moving, often hidden enemies. Tactics employed included night &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks. The conflict lasted for over &lt;unk&gt; years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May &lt;unk&gt;, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the &lt;unk&gt;s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the &lt;unk&gt;s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;s, while in &lt;unk&gt;ictoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s. The south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west of Western Australia experienced warfare from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The war in &lt;unk&gt;ueensland began in the area around Brisbane in the &lt;unk&gt;s and continued until &lt;unk&gt;, moving to central &lt;unk&gt;ueensland in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s, and then to northern &lt;unk&gt;ueensland from the &lt;unk&gt;s to &lt;unk&gt;. In Western Australia, the violence moved north with European settlement, reaching the &lt;unk&gt; region by &lt;unk&gt;, with violent clashes continuing until the &lt;unk&gt;s. In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still, especially in central Australia, continuing from the &lt;unk&gt;s to the &lt;unk&gt;s. One estimate of casualties places European deaths at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are believed to have perished. Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the &lt;unk&gt;th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Wars, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; War &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian ship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria was dispatched to help the New Zealand colonial government in its war against M&lt;unk&gt;ori in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ictoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against M&lt;unk&gt;ori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In late &lt;unk&gt;, the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the &lt;unk&gt; province against the M&lt;unk&gt;ori. &lt;unk&gt; settlement on confiscated land, more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians ( over half of whom were from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria &lt;unk&gt; were recruited to form four &lt;unk&gt; Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing &lt;unk&gt; conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; East, &lt;unk&gt; Hill, &lt;unk&gt; and Te &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; Regiments disbanded in &lt;unk&gt;. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Colonial military forces, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt;, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in &lt;unk&gt;, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units &lt;unk&gt; they remained too small and &lt;unk&gt; to be considered armies in the modern sense. By &lt;unk&gt;, the forces numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with the colonies raising &lt;unk&gt; to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial &lt;unk&gt;, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the &lt;unk&gt;s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General &lt;unk&gt;ames Edwards &lt;unk&gt; who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces &lt;unk&gt; to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid &lt;unk&gt; of brigades of infantry. As a consequence he called for a &lt;unk&gt; of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies. Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be &lt;unk&gt; and for professional units &lt;unk&gt; obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific &lt;unk&gt; to replace the volunteer forces. These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant, Major General Edward Hutton, however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria &lt;unk&gt; the proposal. These reforms remaining unresolved however, and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies. With the exception of Western Australia, the colonies also operated their own navies. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ictoria received its own naval vessel, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, and its deployment to New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt; during the First &lt;unk&gt; War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas. The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats for the defence of harbours and rivers, as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts. &lt;unk&gt;ictoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad &lt;unk&gt; Cerberus in service from &lt;unk&gt;, as well as the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in &lt;unk&gt; and by the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century had two small torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats and a &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Maritime Defence Force was established in &lt;unk&gt;, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS Protector. Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps, while Western Australia &lt;unk&gt;s only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery. Naval personnel from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria took part in the suppression of the &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion in China in &lt;unk&gt;, while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action. The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in &lt;unk&gt;, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sudan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the early years of the &lt;unk&gt;s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed &lt;unk&gt;, known as Mahdi to his followers. In &lt;unk&gt;, as part of the &lt;unk&gt; War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of &lt;unk&gt; their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the evacuation, but he was killed in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February &lt;unk&gt;, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent &lt;unk&gt;s expenses. The New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; consisted of an infantry battalion of &lt;unk&gt; men and &lt;unk&gt; officers, and an artillery battery of &lt;unk&gt; men and sailed from Sydney on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The contingent arrived in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Guards. They subsequently marched for &lt;unk&gt; in a large &lt;unk&gt; square &lt;unk&gt; formation made up of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. Reaching the village, they burned &lt;unk&gt; and returned to &lt;unk&gt; : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting. Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards &lt;unk&gt;, on the Nile. The Australians were then assigned to guard duties, but soon a camel corps was raised and &lt;unk&gt; men volunteered. They &lt;unk&gt; on a reconnaissance to &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May and were heavily involved in a &lt;unk&gt; during which more than &lt;unk&gt; Arabs were killed or captured. On &lt;unk&gt; May, they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March. Meanwhile, the artillery were posted at &lt;unk&gt; and drilled for a month, but they soon rejoined the camp at &lt;unk&gt;. Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in &lt;unk&gt;. The New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; sailed for home on &lt;unk&gt; May, arriving in Sydney on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. Approximately &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second Boer War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result, led to the Second Boer War in &lt;unk&gt;. Pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the deployment of British forces, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Orange Free State and the &lt;unk&gt; Republic under President Paul &lt;unk&gt; declared war on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate &lt;unk&gt; to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of &lt;unk&gt; men from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; who had been training in England before the war, &lt;unk&gt; diverted to South Africa. On &lt;unk&gt; November, the &lt;unk&gt; came under fire for the first time near &lt;unk&gt;, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them. Following a series of minor victories, the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, although no Australian units were involved. The first &lt;unk&gt; of infantry from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on &lt;unk&gt; November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt;ohn Charles &lt;unk&gt;. With a need for increased mobility, they were soon converted into mounted infantry. Further units from &lt;unk&gt;ueensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front. The first casualties occurred soon after at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians, British and artillery attacked a Boer &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; David &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ictor &lt;unk&gt;ones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward &lt;unk&gt;. Regardless, the &lt;unk&gt; were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting, more than &lt;unk&gt; were killed and another &lt;unk&gt; taken prisoner. Five hundred &lt;unk&gt; and the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; subsequently took part in the Siege of &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt;. Despite serious set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backs at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; and with &lt;unk&gt; still under siege &lt;unk&gt; the British mounted a five division counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt;ohn French with the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, &lt;unk&gt; was relieved following the battles of &lt;unk&gt; River and &lt;unk&gt;, and the retreating &lt;unk&gt; defeated at &lt;unk&gt;, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The British entered &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died. Still the advance continued, with the drive to &lt;unk&gt; in May including more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians. &lt;unk&gt;ohannesburg fell on &lt;unk&gt; May, and the &lt;unk&gt; withdrew from &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. &lt;unk&gt; was relieved on &lt;unk&gt; May. Following the defeat of the &lt;unk&gt; republics still the &lt;unk&gt; held out, forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply. This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in &lt;unk&gt;, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Peter &lt;unk&gt; served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes. With the guerrillas requiring supplies, &lt;unk&gt; de la Rey lead a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against &lt;unk&gt;, on the &lt;unk&gt; River in Western &lt;unk&gt;. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by &lt;unk&gt; Australians and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The attack began on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; with heavy shelling causing &lt;unk&gt; casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the &lt;unk&gt;, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted &lt;unk&gt; days, during which more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the &lt;unk&gt; eventually retired. The Siege of &lt;unk&gt; River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on &lt;unk&gt; August. In response the British adopted counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency tactics, including a &lt;unk&gt; earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of &lt;unk&gt; and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the bulk of the fighting was over, and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt;, overwhelming them with superior numbers. &lt;unk&gt; of warfare in last months of &lt;unk&gt;, the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; and were involved in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, killing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, wounding &lt;unk&gt;, and capturing &lt;unk&gt; for the loss of five dead and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Other notable Australian actions included &lt;unk&gt;, Pink Hill, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Australians were not always successful however, suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Mounted Rifles lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded at &lt;unk&gt;, near &lt;unk&gt; after poor security allowed a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to surprise them. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Imperial &lt;unk&gt; lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt;ltimately the &lt;unk&gt; were defeated, and the war ended on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;. In all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in South Africa, and perhaps another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed in action, &lt;unk&gt; died of disease and &lt;unk&gt; missing in action, while a further &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. Six Australians were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion in China began in &lt;unk&gt;, and a number of western nations &lt;unk&gt; including many European powers, the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt; soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In &lt;unk&gt;une, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting &lt;unk&gt; men from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, &lt;unk&gt; from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William &lt;unk&gt;. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade &lt;unk&gt;, who had been trained in both ship handling and &lt;unk&gt; to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were &lt;unk&gt; naval officers and sailors and &lt;unk&gt; permanent soldiers headquartered at &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the &lt;unk&gt; Marine Light Infantry. The &lt;unk&gt; from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria sailed for China on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. Arriving in &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians provided &lt;unk&gt; men to an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at &lt;unk&gt; Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived too late to take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; was captured by western forces. The &lt;unk&gt; joined a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men on a ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day march to the fort, once again only to find that it had already surrendered. The &lt;unk&gt; then garrisoned &lt;unk&gt; and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in &lt;unk&gt;. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and &lt;unk&gt; duties in the Gulf of &lt;unk&gt;, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, &lt;unk&gt; performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as &lt;unk&gt; and fire &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fighters. They left China in March &lt;unk&gt;, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order. Six Australians died from sickness and injury, but none were killed as a result of enemy action. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian military forces at Federation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies. &lt;unk&gt;nder the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ordination of Australia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind &lt;unk&gt;, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army &lt;unk&gt; and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established. The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; and all the colonial forces &lt;unk&gt; including those still in South Africa &lt;unk&gt; became part of the new force. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; colonial soldiers, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; professional soldiers, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; paid militia and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; unpaid volunteers, were subsequently transferred. The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act &lt;unk&gt; brought all the units under one piece of legislation. This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia. However, the majority of soldiers remained in militia units, known as the Citizen Military Forces ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Major General Sir Edward Hutton &lt;unk&gt; a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces &lt;unk&gt; subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on &lt;unk&gt; December and set to work &lt;unk&gt; an integrated structure for the new army. In &lt;unk&gt;, following a report by Lord &lt;unk&gt; the Royal Military College, &lt;unk&gt; was established, as was a system of universal National Service. Prior to federation each self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; governing colony had operated its own naval force. These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities, forcing the separate colonies to &lt;unk&gt; the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades. The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In &lt;unk&gt; Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and &lt;unk&gt;, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government &lt;unk&gt;s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested &lt;unk&gt; that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was unimpressed, and in &lt;unk&gt; invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia. This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ton River &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in &lt;unk&gt;, absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads, consisting of the battlecruiser &lt;unk&gt; Australia, three light cruisers, and three destroyers, while several other ships were still under construction. And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force. The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC &lt;unk&gt; was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in &lt;unk&gt; and was later separated in &lt;unk&gt; to form the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the second oldest air force in the world. Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First World War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of hostilities &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the Australian government rapidly followed suit, with Prime Minister &lt;unk&gt;oseph Cook declaring on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt;... when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia &lt;unk&gt; and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia. This was itself in part due to the large number of British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born citizens and first generation Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Australians that made up the Australian population at the time. Indeed, by the end of the war almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain. As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act &lt;unk&gt;, an all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF &lt;unk&gt; was formed and recruitment began on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. The government pledged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. &lt;unk&gt; and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under &lt;unk&gt; plans drawn up in &lt;unk&gt;. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the &lt;unk&gt;st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war, although small air and naval forces were also committed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Occupation of German New Guinea &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany &lt;unk&gt;s Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man volunteer force &lt;unk&gt; separate from the AIF &lt;unk&gt; and consisting of an infantry battalion plus &lt;unk&gt; naval &lt;unk&gt; and ex &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sailors, was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes. The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on &lt;unk&gt;, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. German New Guinea surrendered on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting, but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine &lt;unk&gt; with all &lt;unk&gt; men aboard. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gallipoli &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. During the journey one of the convoy &lt;unk&gt;s naval escorts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sydney &lt;unk&gt; engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS &lt;unk&gt; at the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; November, in the first ship &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy. Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controlled Egypt to pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers. &lt;unk&gt; to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious &lt;unk&gt; at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; commanded by British general William Birdwood &lt;unk&gt; subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt;. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving its objectives. Australian casualties totalled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; killed. For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, &lt;unk&gt; April, is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, as well as Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original &lt;unk&gt;, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Egypt and Palestine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In &lt;unk&gt; the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australian &lt;unk&gt;s first saw combat during the &lt;unk&gt; uprising in the &lt;unk&gt; Desert and the Nile &lt;unk&gt;alley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February. The advance entered Palestine and an initial, unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on &lt;unk&gt; April. A third assault occurred between &lt;unk&gt; October and &lt;unk&gt; November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part. The battle was a complete success for the British, over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running the Gaza &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Beersheba line and capturing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Turkish soldiers. The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day, after the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Light Horse Brigade charged more than &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt;. The Turkish trenches were overrun, with the Australians capturing the wells at &lt;unk&gt; and securing the valuable water they contained along with over &lt;unk&gt; prisoners for the loss of &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Later, Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at &lt;unk&gt; Ridge, &lt;unk&gt;erusalem and the &lt;unk&gt;. The Turkish government surrendered on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nits of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in &lt;unk&gt; and did so with efficiency and brutality, although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process. Meanwhile, the AFC had undergone remarkable development, and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in &lt;unk&gt;, the first operational flight did not occur until &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; however, when the &lt;unk&gt; Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq. The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Western Front &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March &lt;unk&gt;. I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, suffering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties in a single day. The &lt;unk&gt;st Division entered the line on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, assaulting &lt;unk&gt;, and by the time that they were relieved by the &lt;unk&gt;nd Division on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, they had suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties. Mouquet Farm was attacked in August, with casualties totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; organise, they had suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties in just &lt;unk&gt; days. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;nd and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line, capturing the town of &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; April, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of &lt;unk&gt;, losing over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; captured. On &lt;unk&gt; April, the &lt;unk&gt;st and &lt;unk&gt;nd Divisions were counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacked near &lt;unk&gt; and were forced to abandon the town, before &lt;unk&gt; it again. The &lt;unk&gt;nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of &lt;unk&gt;, beginning on &lt;unk&gt; May, and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the &lt;unk&gt;st Division. Finally, on &lt;unk&gt; May the &lt;unk&gt;th Division relieved the &lt;unk&gt;st, remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; May. Combined these efforts cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian casualties. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the II Anzac Corps &lt;unk&gt; along with two British corps &lt;unk&gt; launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; of explosives that had been placed underneath the &lt;unk&gt; ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; included nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the &lt;unk&gt; Plateau, between September and November &lt;unk&gt;. Individual actions took place at &lt;unk&gt; Road, &lt;unk&gt; Wood, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties. On &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; effort to win the war, &lt;unk&gt; sixty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; three divisions over a &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; front. As the Allies fell back the &lt;unk&gt;rd and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme. The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide. By late May the Germans had pushed to within &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of Paris. During this time the Australians fought at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Wood, &lt;unk&gt;, and Hamel. At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps, Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt;ohn Monash, successfully used combined arms &lt;unk&gt; including aircraft, artillery and armour &lt;unk&gt; in an attack for the first time. The German offensive ground to a halt in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and a brief lull followed, during which the Australians undertook a series of raids, known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Allies soon launched their own offensive &lt;unk&gt; the Hundred Days Offensive &lt;unk&gt; ultimately ending the war. Beginning on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens. &lt;unk&gt;sing the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel, significant gains were made on what became known as the &lt;unk&gt; Black Day &lt;unk&gt; of the German Army. The offensive continued for four months, and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Mont St &lt;unk&gt;uentin, before their final engagement of the war on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;. The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. In all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; served overseas. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded ( a total casualty rate of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Two &lt;unk&gt; on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly towards the end of the fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war. The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation &lt;unk&gt;s involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and &lt;unk&gt; that exist today have their origins in the war. &lt;unk&gt; Australians were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross during the First World War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Inter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war years &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Russian Civil War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the &lt;unk&gt; party assumed power in October &lt;unk&gt;. Following the end of the First World War, the western powers &lt;unk&gt; including Britain &lt;unk&gt; intervened, giving half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hearted support to the pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; White Russian forces. Although the Australian government refused to commit forces, many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting. A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; repatriation in England, about &lt;unk&gt; Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed. The Royal Australian Navy destroyer &lt;unk&gt; Swan was also briefly engaged, carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late &lt;unk&gt;. Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General, Anton &lt;unk&gt; in South Russia, while several more advised Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Siberia. Later, they also served in Mesopotamia as part of &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; Mission, although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and did little fighting. Although the motivations of those Australian &lt;unk&gt;s that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at, it seems unlikely to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for &lt;unk&gt; and courage, winning the only two &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Adelaide was called to the British Solomon Islands &lt;unk&gt; as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by &lt;unk&gt; natives at &lt;unk&gt; on the island of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, known as the &lt;unk&gt; massacre. Arriving at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, the ship proceeded to &lt;unk&gt; to protect the landing of three platoons of troops, then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the &lt;unk&gt;. The ship &lt;unk&gt;s personnel took no part in operations ashore, providing only logistic and communications support. Adelaide returned to Australia on &lt;unk&gt; November. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Spanish Civil War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War, although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades. The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other &lt;unk&gt;, such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion, rather than forming their own units. Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons, while a number were Spanish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin. At least &lt;unk&gt; Australians volunteered, with only one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bull, a conservative &lt;unk&gt; who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War &lt;unk&gt; known to have fought for General Francisco Franco &lt;unk&gt;s Nationalist forces. While a celebrated cause for the Australian left &lt;unk&gt; particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement &lt;unk&gt; the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on an anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; communist basis, rather than a pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Nationalist basis. &lt;unk&gt;, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the &lt;unk&gt; and Services League of Australia ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least &lt;unk&gt; were killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second World War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Europe and the Middle East &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia entered the Second World War on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and &lt;unk&gt; for war. &lt;unk&gt; for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( &lt;unk&gt;nd AIF &lt;unk&gt; began in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Four infantry divisions were formed during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, through which almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were trained during the war. The Australian military &lt;unk&gt;s first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa. During &lt;unk&gt; the light cruiser &lt;unk&gt; Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Iron Flotilla &lt;unk&gt; by Nazi Propaganda Minister &lt;unk&gt;oseph Goebbels &lt;unk&gt; a title proudly accepted by the ships &lt;unk&gt; took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and sank several Italian warships. The Army first saw action in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, when the &lt;unk&gt;th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The division assaulted and captured &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary and &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; February. In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece, and was replaced by the &lt;unk&gt;th Division. The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during &lt;unk&gt;. During April, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division and a brigade of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division were besieged at &lt;unk&gt; ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During &lt;unk&gt;une, the main body of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, a brigade of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Lebanon Campaign against the &lt;unk&gt; French. Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;uly. The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East, and played a key role in the First Battle of El &lt;unk&gt; during &lt;unk&gt;une and the Second Battle of El &lt;unk&gt; in October. The division returned to Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, but several RAAF squadrons and &lt;unk&gt; warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from &lt;unk&gt; until the end of the war. The RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia &lt;unk&gt;s main contribution to the defeat of Germany. Approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF &lt;unk&gt; Command between &lt;unk&gt; and the end of the war. Australians took part in all of &lt;unk&gt; Command &lt;unk&gt;s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. Australian aircrew in &lt;unk&gt; Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost &lt;unk&gt; percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner. Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asia and the Pacific &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From the &lt;unk&gt;s Australia &lt;unk&gt;s defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy, which was embodied by the &lt;unk&gt; Singapore strategy &lt;unk&gt;. This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to &lt;unk&gt;apanese aggression in the region. To this end, a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as the threat from &lt;unk&gt;apan increased. However, as a result of the emphasis on co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pacific region. Measures were taken to improve Australia &lt;unk&gt;s defences as war with &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, but these proved inadequate. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, most of which was stationed in Malaya, and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia. The RAAF was equipped with &lt;unk&gt; aircraft, most of which were obsolete trainers, and the &lt;unk&gt; had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters. The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller &lt;unk&gt;apanese invasion force which landed on &lt;unk&gt; December. The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of &lt;unk&gt;anuary, but was forced to surrender on &lt;unk&gt; February after the &lt;unk&gt;apanese captured much of the island. Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early &lt;unk&gt; at Rabaul, and in Ambon, Timor, and &lt;unk&gt;ava. The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese on &lt;unk&gt; February, to prevent it from being used as an Allied base. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were taken prisoner in early &lt;unk&gt; and endured harsh conditions in &lt;unk&gt;apanese captivity. The prisoners were subjected to &lt;unk&gt;, denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards. As a result, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian prisoners died in captivity. The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese would invade the Australian mainland. While elements of the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Navy proposed this in early &lt;unk&gt;, it was judged to be impossible by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of &lt;unk&gt;nited States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March. Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the &lt;unk&gt; Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and &lt;unk&gt;SAAF. Australian and &lt;unk&gt;S Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the &lt;unk&gt;apanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fought Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Australian Army also defeated a &lt;unk&gt;apanese attempt to capture the town of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; and went onto the offensive in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Lae campaign in April. In late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions played an important role in Operation &lt;unk&gt;, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula during the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula campaign and &lt;unk&gt; Range campaign. The Australian mainland came under attack during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;anuary to &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the &lt;unk&gt;S and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. &lt;unk&gt;apanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against &lt;unk&gt;apanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Australia &lt;unk&gt;s role in the Pacific War declined from &lt;unk&gt;. The increasing size of the &lt;unk&gt;S forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur &lt;unk&gt;s proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late &lt;unk&gt;, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced &lt;unk&gt;S garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and &lt;unk&gt;, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces there. In May &lt;unk&gt;, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and &lt;unk&gt;SAAF and &lt;unk&gt;SN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s defeat and remain controversial. Following &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s surrender on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored. Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of &lt;unk&gt;apanese personnel. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians enlisted during the war, while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; served overseas. Casualties included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; killed and another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Crosses were awarded to Australians. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war period &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and peace &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time defence arrangements &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in &lt;unk&gt;. Plans for post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war defence arrangements were &lt;unk&gt; on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, &lt;unk&gt; others ships in commission and another &lt;unk&gt; in reserved. The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of &lt;unk&gt; squadrons, including four manned by the Citizen Air Force. Meanwhile, in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men in the Citizen Military Forces. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt; was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; raised on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the immediate post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in &lt;unk&gt; the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade which arrived in &lt;unk&gt;apan in February &lt;unk&gt; and was based in &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the &lt;unk&gt;st, &lt;unk&gt;nd and &lt;unk&gt;rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade became the &lt;unk&gt;st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December &lt;unk&gt;, forming the basis of the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan was reduced to a single under &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September &lt;unk&gt; when the &lt;unk&gt; ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean &lt;unk&gt; following the outbreak of the Korean War in &lt;unk&gt;. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons as part of No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing RAAF flying P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mustangs, initially based at &lt;unk&gt; from March &lt;unk&gt;, before transferring to &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. However, by &lt;unk&gt; only No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron remained in &lt;unk&gt;apan. A total of ten &lt;unk&gt; warships served in &lt;unk&gt;apan during this period, including &lt;unk&gt; Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Murchison, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; Ships &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also provided support. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cold War &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early planning and commitments &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the early years of the Cold War, Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations, or a coalition led by either the &lt;unk&gt;nited States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they would most likely operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the deployment of No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in &lt;unk&gt; to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Korean War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the North Korean Army ( KPA &lt;unk&gt; crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul, which fell in less than a week. North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the &lt;unk&gt;nited States offered its assistance to South Korea. In response the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Security Council requested members to assist in &lt;unk&gt; the North Korean attack. Australia initially contributed P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mustang fighter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bomber aircraft from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF and infantry from the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; RAR &lt;unk&gt;, both of which were stationed in &lt;unk&gt;apan as part of the &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The &lt;unk&gt; frigate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the destroyer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were also committed. Later, an aircraft carrier strike group aboard &lt;unk&gt; Sydney was added to the force. By the time &lt;unk&gt; RAR arrived in Pusan on &lt;unk&gt; September, the North Koreans were in retreat following the &lt;unk&gt; landings. As a part of the invasion force under the &lt;unk&gt;N Supreme Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of &lt;unk&gt; near &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, before advancing towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. Further successful actions followed at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt; and at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. North Korean casualties were heavy, while Australian losses included their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green, who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on &lt;unk&gt; November. Meanwhile, during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved &lt;unk&gt; divisions of the People &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;olunteer Army across the &lt;unk&gt; River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA. &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;S and South Korean intelligence, the &lt;unk&gt;th Army Group crossed the border on &lt;unk&gt; October and penetrated up to &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; into North Korea, and were reinforced in early November by &lt;unk&gt; divisions from the &lt;unk&gt;th Army Group ; in total &lt;unk&gt; divisions composed of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. &lt;unk&gt; RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; November. The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake. Following the Chinese intervention, the &lt;unk&gt;N forces were defeated in successive battles and &lt;unk&gt; RAR was forced to withdraw to the &lt;unk&gt;th parallel. A series of battles followed at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital. Further fighting occurred at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; following another Chinese advance, and later at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; San between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; as the &lt;unk&gt;N resumed the offensive. Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in &lt;unk&gt;, with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; April, Chinese forces attacked the &lt;unk&gt; valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw. Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance. After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions, at the cost of &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian, British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian &lt;unk&gt;st Commonwealth Division. The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River. The &lt;unk&gt;st Commonwealth Division counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacked on &lt;unk&gt; October, capturing a number of objectives including Hill &lt;unk&gt; and Hill &lt;unk&gt; during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated. Australian casualties included &lt;unk&gt; dead and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. The &lt;unk&gt; then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War, in which men lived in tunnels, redoubts, and &lt;unk&gt; forts behind barbed wire defences. From &lt;unk&gt; until the end of the war, &lt;unk&gt; RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division &lt;unk&gt;s positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River. Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions, sending &lt;unk&gt; RAR. This battalion remained in Korea for &lt;unk&gt; months, before being replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR in April &lt;unk&gt;. The Australians fought their last battle during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; RAR holding off a &lt;unk&gt; Chinese attack along the &lt;unk&gt; River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt; were suspended on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served during the war, with &lt;unk&gt; killed, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; wounded and &lt;unk&gt; captured. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Malayan Emergency, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Malayan Emergency was declared on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Australian involvement began in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, when in response to a British request, six &lt;unk&gt; from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT &lt;unk&gt; jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation &lt;unk&gt;, five Lincoln bombers destroyed &lt;unk&gt; communist camps, killed &lt;unk&gt; communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The &lt;unk&gt; were withdrawn in &lt;unk&gt;, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing. Based at RAAF Base &lt;unk&gt; they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas. Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October &lt;unk&gt; as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula, consisting of the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; RAR &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; RAR mainly participated in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; operations over the next &lt;unk&gt; months, conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases, as part of &lt;unk&gt;th British Commonwealth Brigade. Contact with the enemy was &lt;unk&gt; and results small, achieving relatively few kills. &lt;unk&gt; RAR left Malaysia October &lt;unk&gt; to be replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR. &lt;unk&gt; RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving &lt;unk&gt; insurgents back into the jungle of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes. Again contact was limited, although &lt;unk&gt; RAR had more success than its predecessor. By late &lt;unk&gt;, operations against the &lt;unk&gt; were in their final phase, and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border. &lt;unk&gt; RAR left Malaysia October &lt;unk&gt; and was replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR. Though patrolling the border &lt;unk&gt; RAR did not make contact with the insurgents, and in October &lt;unk&gt; it was replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR, which stayed in Malaysia until August &lt;unk&gt;. The Malayan Emergency officially ended on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Australia also provided artillery and engineer support, along with an air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; field construction squadron. The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters, firing on suspected communist positions between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served and &lt;unk&gt; died in Malaya &lt;unk&gt; although only &lt;unk&gt; were on operations &lt;unk&gt; and another &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military and Naval growth during the &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At the start of the &lt;unk&gt;s, Prime Minister Robert &lt;unk&gt; greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government &lt;unk&gt;s policy of &lt;unk&gt; Forward Defence &lt;unk&gt; in South East Asia. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; announced a large increase in defence spending. The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; over three years from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; providing a full three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brigade division with nine battalions. The RAAF and &lt;unk&gt; would also both be increased by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, conscription or National Service was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; introduced under the National Service Act, for selected &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds based on date of birth, for a period of two years &lt;unk&gt; continuous full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, three Charles F. Adams &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers were purchased from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States to replace the ageing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers. Traditionally, the &lt;unk&gt; had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant. &lt;unk&gt; Perth and &lt;unk&gt; Hobart joined the fleet in &lt;unk&gt;, followed by &lt;unk&gt; Brisbane in &lt;unk&gt;. Other projects included the construction of six River &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class frigates, the conversion of the aircraft carrier &lt;unk&gt; Melbourne to an anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; submarine role, the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters, and the purchase of six Oberon &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class submarines. The RAAF took delivery of their first &lt;unk&gt; fighters in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; No. &lt;unk&gt;, No. &lt;unk&gt; and No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons with them. The service also received American F &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; strike aircraft, C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transports, P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian &lt;unk&gt; trainers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Indonesia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Malaysia &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Indonesia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Malaysia confrontation was fought from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian &lt;unk&gt; and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia &lt;unk&gt;s continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and &lt;unk&gt; units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from &lt;unk&gt; RAR were used to help &lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; and airborne incursions at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, in September and October &lt;unk&gt;. Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian &lt;unk&gt; Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into &lt;unk&gt; to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the &lt;unk&gt; to remain on the defensive, under the &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions. &lt;unk&gt; RAR deployed to Borneo in March &lt;unk&gt;, and served in &lt;unk&gt; until the end of &lt;unk&gt;uly, operating on both sides of the border. The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones &lt;unk&gt; including at Sungei &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents. &lt;unk&gt; RAR served a less &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eventful tour between April and August &lt;unk&gt;, and also operated over the border, successfully &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; on a number of occasions. A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was also deployed in &lt;unk&gt; and again in &lt;unk&gt;, taking part in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the &lt;unk&gt;, even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance. Other units included artillery and engineers, while a number of &lt;unk&gt; ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the Singapore Strait. The RAAF played a relatively minor role, although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated. Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border missions only occurred in &lt;unk&gt;. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early &lt;unk&gt; which brought General &lt;unk&gt; to power, a peace treaty was signed in August &lt;unk&gt; which ended the conflict. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served during &lt;unk&gt; ; casualties included &lt;unk&gt; dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War, and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the &lt;unk&gt;s and early &lt;unk&gt;s. As a consequence, Australia supported South &lt;unk&gt;ietnam throughout the early &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the leader of the South &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese government, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, asked for assistance from the &lt;unk&gt;S and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North &lt;unk&gt;ietnam. Australia offered &lt;unk&gt; military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team &lt;unk&gt;ietnam, which became known simply as &lt;unk&gt; The Team &lt;unk&gt;. They arrived in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August &lt;unk&gt;, beginning Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in the war. Later in August &lt;unk&gt;, the RAAF sent a flight of &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft to the port city of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. However, with the security situation in South &lt;unk&gt;ietnam continuing to deteriorate, the &lt;unk&gt;S increased its involvement to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; combat troops by early &lt;unk&gt;. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the &lt;unk&gt; RAR to serve with the &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; Airborne Brigade in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; province in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions, including Gang &lt;unk&gt;, Operation &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized unit &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;st Australian Task Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to replace &lt;unk&gt; RAR. Included were a large number of conscripts, under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme. &lt;unk&gt; of two infantry battalions as well as armour, aviation, artillery and other support arms, the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in &lt;unk&gt; Tuy Province. Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF. At the Battle of Long Tan on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, D Company, &lt;unk&gt; RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a &lt;unk&gt;iet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself. &lt;unk&gt; Australians were killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while &lt;unk&gt; communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield. The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over &lt;unk&gt; Tuy Province and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February &lt;unk&gt; the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded in a single week, the bulk during Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Yet with the &lt;unk&gt; Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was subsequently deployed &lt;unk&gt; infiltration routes leading to Saigon to &lt;unk&gt; communist movement against the capital as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in May and &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. At Fire Support &lt;unk&gt; Coral and &lt;unk&gt; the Australians had clashed with regular North &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese Army and &lt;unk&gt;iet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During &lt;unk&gt; days of fighting Australian casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while communist casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed confirmed by body count, &lt;unk&gt; possibly killed, &lt;unk&gt; wounded and &lt;unk&gt; captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; and early &lt;unk&gt; and Long &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. At the height of the Australian commitment, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in &lt;unk&gt;, and four &lt;unk&gt; destroyers joined &lt;unk&gt;S patrols in the waters off North &lt;unk&gt;ietnam. The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November &lt;unk&gt;. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of &lt;unk&gt;ietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, &lt;unk&gt; RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during &lt;unk&gt; as part of a phased withdrawal, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese troops until withdrawn on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; by the newly elected Labor government of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War was Australia &lt;unk&gt;s longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation &lt;unk&gt;s military involvement increased a vocal anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war movement developed. More than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in &lt;unk&gt;ietnam ; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. Four were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Creation of the Australian Defence Force, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although the importance of &lt;unk&gt; joint &lt;unk&gt; warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ordination between the services in the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military &lt;unk&gt;s experiences in the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War. In &lt;unk&gt;, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur &lt;unk&gt;, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The &lt;unk&gt; Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence &lt;unk&gt; ( Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply &lt;unk&gt; into a single Department of Defence in &lt;unk&gt;, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Today, the &lt;unk&gt; is headquartered at Russell &lt;unk&gt; in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, Northern Command is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Defence of Australia, &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ntil the &lt;unk&gt;s, Australia &lt;unk&gt;s military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia &lt;unk&gt;s region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in &lt;unk&gt;, and the British withdrawal &lt;unk&gt; east of Suez &lt;unk&gt; in the early &lt;unk&gt;s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation &lt;unk&gt;s northern maritime approaches ( the &lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sea gap &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against possible attack. In line with this goal, the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the &lt;unk&gt; and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the &lt;unk&gt; had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; coups d &lt;unk&gt;tat. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the &lt;unk&gt; to improve its capability to rapidly respond to &lt;unk&gt; events. During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; agreed in &lt;unk&gt; to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in &lt;unk&gt;, and the two &lt;unk&gt; fighter squadrons in &lt;unk&gt;. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company &lt;unk&gt; have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighter aircraft. Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. &lt;unk&gt; and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the &lt;unk&gt; have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of &lt;unk&gt; and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gulf War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the &lt;unk&gt; Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about &lt;unk&gt; personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the &lt;unk&gt; and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some &lt;unk&gt; personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with &lt;unk&gt;S and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fly zones imposed over Iraq between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Global security, late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Since the late &lt;unk&gt;s, the Australian government had increasingly called upon the &lt;unk&gt; to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;, Cambodia between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and from &lt;unk&gt; onwards. The &lt;unk&gt; election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force structure and role, with the new government &lt;unk&gt;s defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operation with regional states and Australia &lt;unk&gt;s allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia &lt;unk&gt;s global security interests. In line with this new focus, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s combat effectiveness. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Millennium &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; East Timor, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The former &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in &lt;unk&gt;, however, following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; subsequently agreed to allow the East &lt;unk&gt; to vote on autonomy in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Mission in East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was established to organise and conduct the vote, which was held at the end of August &lt;unk&gt; and resulted with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and &lt;unk&gt; and many East &lt;unk&gt; were killed, while perhaps more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were displaced. &lt;unk&gt;nable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to &lt;unk&gt;, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;N force operating in accordance with &lt;unk&gt;N resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nder the overall command of Australian Major General Peter &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; began arriving on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting &lt;unk&gt;, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; established its headquarters in Dili on &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a &lt;unk&gt;N peacekeeping force, the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; over of command of military operations from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; was completed on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. Australia continued to support the &lt;unk&gt;N peacekeeping operation with between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, as well as landing craft and &lt;unk&gt; helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and at &lt;unk&gt; in October &lt;unk&gt;. However, with the security situation &lt;unk&gt; the bulk of the Australian and &lt;unk&gt;N forces were withdrawn by &lt;unk&gt;. Two Australians died from non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action. The unexpected deployment to East Timor in &lt;unk&gt; led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the &lt;unk&gt; Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the &lt;unk&gt; for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of &lt;unk&gt; units, expanding the &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; per year. In May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;, following unrest between elements of the Timor &lt;unk&gt; Defence Force. Australian forces were involved in a number &lt;unk&gt; during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at Same on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. However, by early &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the security situation had been &lt;unk&gt; and just &lt;unk&gt; Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a &lt;unk&gt;, the International &lt;unk&gt; Force commenced withdrawing from Timor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in November &lt;unk&gt;, a process which was completed in April &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Afghanistan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, Australian forces were committed to the American &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; led international coalition against terrorism. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most visible contribution &lt;unk&gt; codenamed Operation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and again from mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to fight against the &lt;unk&gt;. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from &lt;unk&gt; to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the &lt;unk&gt; National Army. Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Orion surveillance aircraft and three C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since &lt;unk&gt;, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation &lt;unk&gt;. A detachment of four F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while two Boeing &lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt; aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in &lt;unk&gt; to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in &lt;unk&gt; airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction &lt;unk&gt; in April &lt;unk&gt;. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to &lt;unk&gt; by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with further small increases to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency operations in &lt;unk&gt; Province in conjunction &lt;unk&gt;nited States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By &lt;unk&gt; it included a combined arms battalion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized battle group known as the &lt;unk&gt; Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; Wing Group flying CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Force &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, a further &lt;unk&gt; Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but are located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, &lt;unk&gt; of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al &lt;unk&gt; Air Base in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Arab Emirates. Also included is the deployment of one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties. Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and Operation Perth in &lt;unk&gt;, as well as actions in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, the Shah &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a &lt;unk&gt; in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; ; however, approximately &lt;unk&gt; personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and are stationed in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Iraq, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Iraq. The initial contribution was also a modest one, consisting of just &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel &lt;unk&gt; codenamed Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Major force elements included special forces, &lt;unk&gt; and fixed wing aviation and naval units. Army units included elements from the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando &lt;unk&gt;, a CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; detachment and a number of other specialist units. &lt;unk&gt; units included the amphibious ship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the frigates &lt;unk&gt; Darwin and &lt;unk&gt; Anzac, while the RAAF deployed &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hornets from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron, a number of AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq, while for a few days, the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the &lt;unk&gt;. During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War, with No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron flying a total of &lt;unk&gt; sorties and dropping &lt;unk&gt; laser &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guided bombs. The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially take part in the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designated the Al &lt;unk&gt; Task Group and including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; light armoured vehicles and infantry &lt;unk&gt; was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April &lt;unk&gt; as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The role of this force was to protect the &lt;unk&gt;apanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The &lt;unk&gt; later became the &lt;unk&gt; Battle Group ( West &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ( W &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, following the hand back of Al &lt;unk&gt; province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel in May &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt; ( W &lt;unk&gt; in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team &lt;unk&gt; Iraq. A &lt;unk&gt; frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin &lt;unk&gt; the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while RAAF and &lt;unk&gt; operations were &lt;unk&gt; to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level operations continued, however, with a small Australian force of &lt;unk&gt; soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of &lt;unk&gt; under Operation &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was finally withdrawn in August &lt;unk&gt;, and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia &lt;unk&gt;s diplomatic presence in Iraq. Although more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel served during operations in Iraq, Australian casualties were relatively light, with two soldiers accidentally killed, while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force. A further &lt;unk&gt; personnel were wounded. Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. This operation concluded in November &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military intervention against &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; a small number of &lt;unk&gt; personnel were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the &lt;unk&gt; Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct &lt;unk&gt; of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to &lt;unk&gt; arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controlled northern Iraq. In late September &lt;unk&gt; an Air Task Group ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Special Operations Task Group ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were deployed to Al &lt;unk&gt; Air Base in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. &lt;unk&gt; with F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Super &lt;unk&gt; strike aircraft, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Multi Role &lt;unk&gt; Transport, and an E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Airborne Early Warning &lt;unk&gt; Control aircraft, the &lt;unk&gt; began operations on &lt;unk&gt; October. The &lt;unk&gt; is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strong unit known as Task Group &lt;unk&gt; was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. &lt;unk&gt; were extended to Syria in September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse, and included participation in both &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations sponsored missions, as well as those as part of ad &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hoc coalitions. Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as &lt;unk&gt; ; however &lt;unk&gt; in comparative international terms, Australia has only been a moderately energetic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for &lt;unk&gt; years &lt;unk&gt; being among the first group of &lt;unk&gt;N military observers in Indonesia in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; its commitments have generally been limited, consisting mostly of small numbers of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level and technical support troops such as &lt;unk&gt;, engineers, &lt;unk&gt;, observers, and police. One significant commitment has been Australia &lt;unk&gt;s ongoing involvement with the long running &lt;unk&gt; Force and Observers in the Sinai. The operational tempo started increasing in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, when Australia became involved in a series of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; profile operations, deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia, &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. Australia has been involved in close to &lt;unk&gt; separate missions, involving more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel ; &lt;unk&gt; Australians have died during these operations. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Randy Blythe &lt;unk&gt; case &lt;unk&gt; The Randy Blythe &lt;unk&gt; case was a court case in the Czech Republic, stemming from a &lt;unk&gt; Lamb of God concert in Prague, wherein &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old fan Daniel &lt;unk&gt; sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death. During the investigation, Czech police unsuccessfully asked &lt;unk&gt;nited States authorities for cooperation. When the band returned to the Czech Republic for another concert two years later, its vocalist Randy Blythe was arrested, charged with causing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, and &lt;unk&gt; in custody for five weeks. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was proven that Blythe had thrown &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held &lt;unk&gt; liable, and most of the blame lay with &lt;unk&gt; and security members. The &lt;unk&gt; was upheld by the Prague High Court on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; concert incident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During a concert on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, in the Prague club, &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old attending fan. According to &lt;unk&gt; statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper &lt;unk&gt; following Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest, Blythe was chanting &lt;unk&gt; Come on up &lt;unk&gt; between songs, which, the newspaper stated, may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans. The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage, falling backwards directly on his head. According to the same paper, &lt;unk&gt; was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, suffered serious brain trauma, fell into a coma, and died weeks later from his injuries. A report about the concert at issue released on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage. &lt;unk&gt; The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by &lt;unk&gt; alleged that &lt;unk&gt; Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an &lt;unk&gt; fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the report by &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; approach of the band towards the stage &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; divers... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down. &lt;unk&gt; Following Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest, Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a promoter of the concert, said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe, and that &lt;unk&gt; it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be. &lt;unk&gt; According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the &lt;unk&gt; and rushed Randy during the performance. It is alleged that the third time, security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head. &lt;unk&gt; However, it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than &lt;unk&gt;. Guitarist Willie &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; I can &lt;unk&gt;t recall that particular show, let alone a fan being beaten on the stage. I think I would &lt;unk&gt;ve noticed something like that considering the &lt;unk&gt; thing. &lt;unk&gt; According to Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s attorney Martin &lt;unk&gt;, the police launched an investigation following the death of &lt;unk&gt;, about a month after the concert and following a coma. After interviewing several &lt;unk&gt; from the concert, the police asked the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Department of &lt;unk&gt;ustice to take part in the investigation ; however, they refused to cooperate and, &lt;unk&gt;, did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and charges &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe was arrested by the Czech police on suspicion of &lt;unk&gt;. Lamb of God was prepared to play in Prague on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, but Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest upon arrival at &lt;unk&gt; Airport caused the concert to be canceled. According to T&lt;unk&gt; Nova, Blythe stated that he had not been aware of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death and expressed his remorse. A police spokesperson stated on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; that the police had formally charged Blythe under section &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Czech Criminal Code, which contains intentional &lt;unk&gt; of bodily harm resulting in death ( i.e. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; years of imprisonment if found guilty. Randy &lt;unk&gt;s brother Mark Blythe said the charge was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and will be dropped immediately. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Court &lt;unk&gt; and bail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the State Attorney brought a motion to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe in pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trial detention, as he considered Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Prague &lt;unk&gt; District Court ruled that Blythe will be held on &lt;unk&gt;, with the possibility of a bail of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s alleged annual income ; Blythe was held in &lt;unk&gt; Prison. &lt;unk&gt; was deposited in the court &lt;unk&gt;s bank account on mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day of &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by &lt;unk&gt; court, the Prague Municipal Court. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Prague Municipal Court &lt;unk&gt;s panel of three judges headed by judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and &lt;unk&gt; or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; court rejected the State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s second complaint and ordered Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s immediate release. Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day, claiming in an interview with T&lt;unk&gt; Nova that he would return for the trial. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the spokesperson of the Prague State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s Office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe. After reviewing the case file, the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Two weeks later, a judge set the trial to commence on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days. Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person. The case was heard by a panel of the Prague Municipal Court, consisting of presiding professional judge Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and two lay judges. Trials in the Czech Republic are public. In general, the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the &lt;unk&gt; ; however, it is not bound by its legal assessment by the State Attorney. Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and &lt;unk&gt;. Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in &lt;unk&gt; ; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these &lt;unk&gt;, the defendant may also &lt;unk&gt; a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of &lt;unk&gt; Rights and Basic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; State Attorney &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against Blythe was brought by State Attorney &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had tried a number of murderers, such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( life in prison &lt;unk&gt;, Roman &lt;unk&gt; ( life imprisonment at &lt;unk&gt;st instance, &lt;unk&gt; years on appeal &lt;unk&gt;, Maria &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; years imprisonment &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; years imprisonment &lt;unk&gt;. He also tried a case against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting &lt;unk&gt; years in prison for ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted &lt;unk&gt; due to lack of evidence ; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different &lt;unk&gt; of the Municipal Court. Another of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s murder cases which ended in &lt;unk&gt; due to insufficient evidence is that of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a vice &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; chairman of the Czech Football Association. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Defense lawyers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Randy Blythe was represented by Prague lawyers Martin &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; studied law at the Faculty of Law of Charles &lt;unk&gt;niversity and at the New York &lt;unk&gt;niversity. From &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, he served as external advisor of the then Prime Minister &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A former partner at Baker &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; established &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Co. in &lt;unk&gt;. He is also a member of board of directors of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; gained fame as attorney of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a Kurdish national who was first charged in &lt;unk&gt; with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture. It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history, as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against &lt;unk&gt; until he was &lt;unk&gt; by the Municipal Court in Prague in &lt;unk&gt;. The court held that although the crimes did take place, there is no evidence that &lt;unk&gt; took part in it. He was also defending judge Pavel &lt;unk&gt;, who was indicted of accepting a &lt;unk&gt;. The proceedings ended with &lt;unk&gt; being found insane and &lt;unk&gt; not liable. &lt;unk&gt; also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a &lt;unk&gt; of Czech &lt;unk&gt; indicted on charges of rape and torture. During the proceedings, the judge sent &lt;unk&gt; to face the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived as &lt;unk&gt; behaviour bordering on contempt &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The trial started on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; told him that the club was terrible and &lt;unk&gt;. According to Blythe, the &lt;unk&gt; went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous. Blythe, who is &lt;unk&gt;, took off his glasses before entering the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan &lt;unk&gt; by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, &lt;unk&gt; rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s collar, pushed him on the ground, &lt;unk&gt; on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw &lt;unk&gt; trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security. Later, when another fan tried to climb the stage, Blythe thought that it was &lt;unk&gt; again. Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, author of video which caught the previous incidents with &lt;unk&gt;, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him &lt;unk&gt; up. Blythe insisted that he never saw &lt;unk&gt; nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death. Blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris &lt;unk&gt;, Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s drummer, testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage. Blythe also alleged that after learning about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, he had written a letter to the &lt;unk&gt; family, in which he offered help and a meeting in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; person. Daniel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The &lt;unk&gt; family &lt;unk&gt;s representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, eight witnesses delivered their testimonies on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Among them were friends of Daniel &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and three friends had come to attend the concert from &lt;unk&gt;, a town in mountains some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of Prague. They described &lt;unk&gt; as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an &lt;unk&gt; from a guitar player before the concert had started. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s friend &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; climbed the stage, and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage. He said he was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sure Blythe pushed &lt;unk&gt; with both hands. &lt;unk&gt; He further said that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s behavior &lt;unk&gt; from all the concerts he had attended in the past, commenting that Blythe was visibly furious. He further claimed that &lt;unk&gt; was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe, with another fan being kicked, choked and receiving a punch from Blythe. &lt;unk&gt; corroborated Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s testimony that Blythe asked &lt;unk&gt; Are you okay? &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as &lt;unk&gt; fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to &lt;unk&gt;, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s other friend &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore. &lt;unk&gt; climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, &lt;unk&gt; fell directly on the ground. According to &lt;unk&gt;, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. &lt;unk&gt; further testified that after the fall, &lt;unk&gt; went to sit on a bench, where he was &lt;unk&gt; a water bottle. &lt;unk&gt; began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a &lt;unk&gt; at the back of his head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. &lt;unk&gt; said that he understood Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage. Another person to testify was Robert &lt;unk&gt;, who worked as a security guard the night of the incident. &lt;unk&gt; said that the &lt;unk&gt; was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan &lt;unk&gt;s fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely. Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in &lt;unk&gt; and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that &lt;unk&gt; and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage ; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Milan &lt;unk&gt;, the fan whom Blythe admitted to &lt;unk&gt; off the stage, testified on the third day of the trial. &lt;unk&gt; said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. &lt;unk&gt; testified that Blythe knocked him down, &lt;unk&gt; on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not &lt;unk&gt; him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage. Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s fall at the end of the concert. The judge also read a sworn statement from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former producer, who stated that she had not known about the incident. She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening, but learned about the reasons for that only later, during the police investigation. The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; from the stage. &lt;unk&gt; Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; testified that although this was not the case, the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert. Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day. The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions. The judge went again through the Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s testimony and, with a view to the previous witness statements, asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan &lt;unk&gt; whom Blythe threw off the stage. Blythe responded by saying : &lt;unk&gt; To the best of my knowledge, it was Milan &lt;unk&gt; who was coming up &lt;unk&gt; on stage &lt;unk&gt; every time. &lt;unk&gt; Also that day, expert medical witness &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took the stand. According to The Prague Post, &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; added that the &lt;unk&gt; mortality rate from this kind of injury is around &lt;unk&gt; percent, and that doctors couldn &lt;unk&gt;t have done more to save the patient. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue, where the initial diagnosis took place. Since this hospital did not have a specialized &lt;unk&gt; department, &lt;unk&gt; was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis. There, &lt;unk&gt; underwent two operations, first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone. Finally, defense asked for &lt;unk&gt; as a key witness fell ill. The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day, after which the hearings would be &lt;unk&gt; until March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, in order to hear the defense &lt;unk&gt;s witness. Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, only one witness took the stand before the hearing was &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he &lt;unk&gt; didn &lt;unk&gt;t like the description of the situation &lt;unk&gt; by the previous witnesses. He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night, and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show. He also said that each time somebody got on the stage, Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there. &lt;unk&gt; testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive, somebody aided his fall from behind. He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground. &lt;unk&gt; had trouble recalling details from the show, as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in &lt;unk&gt;, and thus could not describe, among other things, the position of the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The trial resumed on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, appointed by the court &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, appointed by the defense &lt;unk&gt;. Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two &lt;unk&gt;. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage. The ambulance arrived &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; minutes later. Another &lt;unk&gt; was a fan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who testified that she saw Blythe &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; e climbed onto the stage, and when he tried to stand up, Blythe &lt;unk&gt; him. &lt;unk&gt; According to her, the &lt;unk&gt; was strong enough for &lt;unk&gt; to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment. She testified that &lt;unk&gt; fell backwards. Another &lt;unk&gt; of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A defense &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; appointed expert witness in the field of &lt;unk&gt; testified on March &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; could not turn &lt;unk&gt; degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head. He further said that if &lt;unk&gt; fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the &lt;unk&gt; testimonies, according to which &lt;unk&gt; fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points. In his closing speech, the State Attorney asked the court to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe for &lt;unk&gt; years, claiming that &lt;unk&gt; even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury. &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; family representative said that based on the witness testimonies, the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible. He continued that he would not be &lt;unk&gt; the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father &lt;unk&gt;s birthday, and his mother has consequently become a &lt;unk&gt; patient unable to work. In his closing word, Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so. He further commented that in case of &lt;unk&gt;, measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First instance verdict &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the court delivered a verdict, according to which Blythe was not &lt;unk&gt; liable for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, even though he had the moral responsibility for it. Consequently, the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s bail. The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown &lt;unk&gt; off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his &lt;unk&gt;, could have mistaken &lt;unk&gt; for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the &lt;unk&gt;. According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the &lt;unk&gt; and security members. &lt;unk&gt;udge &lt;unk&gt; further &lt;unk&gt; Blythe for not having met with the &lt;unk&gt; family. The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Appeals verdict &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the Prague High Court, chaired by judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The hearing took place in Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s absence. Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; was upheld by the panel on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the Supreme Court. As the appeal hasn &lt;unk&gt;t been lodged by &lt;unk&gt; within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict, it has become final. In &lt;unk&gt; Blythe demanded ca &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millions for damages but the Municipal Court for Prague &lt;unk&gt; dismissed the suit. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In reaction to the arrest and detention, a fan created a petition at the official White House petition site. By the time Blythe was released on bail, it gathered over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; signatures. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s hometown of Richmond, &lt;unk&gt;irginia, by a friend of Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s. At the event, &lt;unk&gt; ( who are also from Richmond &lt;unk&gt; frontman Dave &lt;unk&gt; said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested. I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up.... This stuff could have all been worked out &lt;unk&gt; or legally before he got there. ” In addition to &lt;unk&gt;, other notable figures in heavy metal, such as Tom Araya and David &lt;unk&gt;, have also come out in support of Blythe. In a post to his blog, Blythe explained that he met the &lt;unk&gt; family in private after the trial, and promised them to be &lt;unk&gt; a spokesperson for safer shows &lt;unk&gt;. He emphasized that the family never attacked him and &lt;unk&gt; just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Hurricane &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hurricane &lt;unk&gt; was a Category &lt;unk&gt; hurricane that killed four people after &lt;unk&gt; the western coast of Mexico in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; from an area of disturbed weather on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, several hundred miles south of Mexico, &lt;unk&gt; gradually intensified. &lt;unk&gt; latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The following morning, &lt;unk&gt; attained winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; as it passed roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; dissipated over open waters. Prior to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the &lt;unk&gt; River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of &lt;unk&gt; were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in &lt;unk&gt; a severe drought. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meteorological history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis. Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwestward. Gradually, convection consolidated around an area of low pressure. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a Tropical Cyclone Formation &lt;unk&gt; was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within &lt;unk&gt; hours. On the following day, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E by the National Hurricane Center at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;TC. &lt;unk&gt;pon being declared, the depression was located about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Mexico. However, after post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; analysis, the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier. &lt;unk&gt; a west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment, characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;. Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt;, the second named storm of the season. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, convection increased markedly with several &lt;unk&gt; tops ( denoted by cloud &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; top temperatures below &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in &lt;unk&gt; outflow also took place. As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, &lt;unk&gt; acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a hurricane hunter aircraft found &lt;unk&gt; just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; wide eye developed within the central dense &lt;unk&gt;. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated &lt;unk&gt; to have attained winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; along with a barometric pressure of &lt;unk&gt; mbar ( hPa ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inHg &lt;unk&gt; ; however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Wisconsin and the &lt;unk&gt; Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. &lt;unk&gt; later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system &lt;unk&gt;s structure, the NHC downgraded &lt;unk&gt; to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on &lt;unk&gt;. The storm &lt;unk&gt;s remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Preparations and impact &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between &lt;unk&gt; and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; to Punta San &lt;unk&gt;. Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna. As &lt;unk&gt; continued to strengthen, the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the easternmost advisories were discontinued as &lt;unk&gt; moved away. Later that morning, all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s rapid weakening. In Colima and &lt;unk&gt;, residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. In Colima, &lt;unk&gt; shelters were opened to the public. Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief. A total of &lt;unk&gt; temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, many of which were in Acapulco, as many residents were expected to evacuate flood &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; prone area. An orange &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains. Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( National Weather Service &lt;unk&gt; advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of &lt;unk&gt;. Across Guerrero, &lt;unk&gt; produced heavy rain, peaking at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Guerrero. Several homes across the state were damaged, though none were destroyed. In Acapulco, &lt;unk&gt; homes were inundated by flood waters, prompting &lt;unk&gt; in areas built in &lt;unk&gt; to relocate residents after Hurricane Pauline. Several landslides blocked off roads and a &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; section of a roundabout was destroyed. In the community of &lt;unk&gt;, three people were killed after being washed away by flood waters. Heavy rains from &lt;unk&gt; caused the &lt;unk&gt; River to overflow its banks, placing &lt;unk&gt; homes across &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; under water. One person drowned in San Agust&lt;unk&gt;n after falling in the swollen river. Twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seven &lt;unk&gt; in and around the city lost power after muddy &lt;unk&gt; entered a &lt;unk&gt;. Throughout Oaxaca, at least a dozen homes lost their roofs due to high winds. &lt;unk&gt; of Colima, Chiapas, Michoac&lt;unk&gt;n and &lt;unk&gt; experienced heavy rains ; however, in many areas, the rain proved beneficial in &lt;unk&gt; a severe drought.  &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, Mississippi &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of Mississippi, in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. It is the county seat of Lauderdale County and the principal city of the Meridian, Mississippi &lt;unk&gt; Statistical Area. Along major highways, the city is &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;ackson, Mississippi ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; west of Birmingham, Alabama ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana ; and &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Memphis, Tennessee. Established in &lt;unk&gt;, at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi, Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s economy was built on the railways and goods transported on them, and it became a strategic trading center. During the American Civil War, General William &lt;unk&gt; Sherman burned much of the city to the ground in the Battle of Meridian ( February, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; after the war, the city entered a &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age &lt;unk&gt; it become the largest city in Mississippi between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and a leading center for manufacturing in the South, with &lt;unk&gt; trains arriving and departing daily. &lt;unk&gt;nion Station, built in &lt;unk&gt;, is now a multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; modal center, giving access to the Meridian Transit System, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, averaging &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; passengers per year. Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry, the city has diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people in &lt;unk&gt;. The population within the city limits, according to &lt;unk&gt; census estimates, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people respectively are in the labor force, feed the economy of the city. The area is served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which provide over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; jobs. &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is home to the Regional Counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Academy ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state. Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in &lt;unk&gt;. The field is now home to the &lt;unk&gt;th Air &lt;unk&gt; Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the &lt;unk&gt; Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; military employer in the region, employing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people. Among the city &lt;unk&gt;s many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center, the Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries, one for whites and one for African Americans. The Carnegie Branch Library, now demolished, was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern &lt;unk&gt;nited States during the segregation era. The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; Father of Country Music &lt;unk&gt;, was born in Meridian. Highland Park houses a museum which displays &lt;unk&gt; of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; engine era. The park is also home to the Highland Park &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a National Historic Landmark. It is the world &lt;unk&gt;s only two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; row stationary &lt;unk&gt; menagerie in existence. Other notable natives include Miss America &lt;unk&gt; Susan &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in &lt;unk&gt;, and Hartley &lt;unk&gt;, founder of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; headquartered in Meridian. The federal &lt;unk&gt; was the site of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; trial of suspects in the murder of &lt;unk&gt; and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Previously inhabited by the &lt;unk&gt; Native Americans, the area now called Meridian was obtained by the &lt;unk&gt;nited States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing &lt;unk&gt; Creek in &lt;unk&gt; during the period of Indian &lt;unk&gt;. After the treaty was ratified, European &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American settlers began to move into the area. After receiving a federal land grant of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt;, the first settler of Meridian, began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area. Most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s land was bought in &lt;unk&gt; by Lewis A. &lt;unk&gt;, a lawyer from Alabama. &lt;unk&gt;ohn T. Ball, a merchant from &lt;unk&gt; County, bought the remaining &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and Ball, now known as the founders of the city, began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections. There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement. Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, &lt;unk&gt; believing the term to be synonymous with &lt;unk&gt; junction &lt;unk&gt; ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( meaning &lt;unk&gt; mad river &lt;unk&gt; in a Native American language &lt;unk&gt;, from the name of a nearby creek ; and &lt;unk&gt; proposed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; City. &lt;unk&gt; Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad &lt;unk&gt; the sign on which would alternate between &lt;unk&gt; Meridian &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; each day. Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left &lt;unk&gt; Meridian &lt;unk&gt; on the station permanently. The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in &lt;unk&gt;. Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war. During the Battle of Meridian in &lt;unk&gt;, General William &lt;unk&gt; Sherman led troops into the city, destroying the railroads in every direction, as well as an arsenal and immense &lt;unk&gt; ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground. Sherman is reported to have said afterwards, &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, with its depots, store &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; houses, arsenal, hospitals, offices, hotels, and &lt;unk&gt; no longer exists. &lt;unk&gt; Despite the destruction, the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired, back in operation &lt;unk&gt; working days after the battle. Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era, with the riot of &lt;unk&gt; following a fire that damaged many businesses. The town &lt;unk&gt; in the aftermath of the Civil War, and experienced its &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries, which caused a population boom. As the population rose, commercial activity increased in the downtown area. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South. Many of the city &lt;unk&gt;s historic buildings were built during and just after this era, including the Grand Opera House in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; School in &lt;unk&gt;, two Carnegie libraries in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; Building, Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s tallest skyscraper, in &lt;unk&gt;. The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government &lt;unk&gt;s efforts to bring in &lt;unk&gt; new industrial plants in &lt;unk&gt; and a booming automobile industry in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Even through the stock market crash of &lt;unk&gt; and the following Great Depression, the city continued to attract new businesses. With &lt;unk&gt; becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression, the S. H. Kress &lt;unk&gt; Co. building, built to &lt;unk&gt; provide luxury to the common man, &lt;unk&gt; opened in downtown Meridian, as did the Temple Theater, which was used as a movie house. The federal &lt;unk&gt; was built in &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; project. After a brief &lt;unk&gt; of the economy at the end of the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region &lt;unk&gt;s rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the &lt;unk&gt;s, when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails. The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses, resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas. During the American Civil Rights Movement in the &lt;unk&gt;s, Meridian was home to a Council of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; office and several other activist organizations. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; and other local residents, along with Michael &lt;unk&gt;, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from the North, worked to create a community center, holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote. Whites in the area resented the activism, and racial tension often resulted in violence. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Goodman went to &lt;unk&gt; County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam. Seven &lt;unk&gt;, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted in the federal &lt;unk&gt; in Meridian of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the victims of their civil rights &lt;unk&gt; and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial. It was the first time that a white jury had convicted &lt;unk&gt; a white official in a civil rights killing. &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the case was reopened by the state, which brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray &lt;unk&gt; was convicted of &lt;unk&gt; and sentenced to &lt;unk&gt; years in prison. Meridian later honored &lt;unk&gt; by renaming a portion of &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the &lt;unk&gt;s and following the construction of highways that made &lt;unk&gt; easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic &lt;unk&gt; and Landmarks Commission was created in &lt;unk&gt;, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in &lt;unk&gt;. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to &lt;unk&gt; downtown, including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in &lt;unk&gt; based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s Golden Age ; it had been demolished. Other projects included the renovation of the &lt;unk&gt; Building in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Restaurant in &lt;unk&gt;, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in &lt;unk&gt; for use as the &lt;unk&gt; Mississippi State &lt;unk&gt;niversity Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts. &lt;unk&gt; After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late &lt;unk&gt;, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown &lt;unk&gt; effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the &lt;unk&gt; Building, but newly elected Mayor &lt;unk&gt; Barry killed the plans in early &lt;unk&gt;. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hotels &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels. Even before Meridian reached its &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age, &lt;unk&gt; several large hotels, including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels, were built before the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original &lt;unk&gt;nion Station in &lt;unk&gt;, many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers. The &lt;unk&gt; Hotel was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;. Hotel Meridian was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;nion Hotel was built in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nion Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in &lt;unk&gt;, and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian &lt;unk&gt;rban Center Historic District. As the city grew, the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy, as evidenced by the eleven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in &lt;unk&gt;. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in &lt;unk&gt;, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In &lt;unk&gt; it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The &lt;unk&gt; Young Hotel was built in &lt;unk&gt;. A staple in the African &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American business district that developed west of the city &lt;unk&gt;s core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room. As the city suburbs developed in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, most hotels moved outside of downtown. &lt;unk&gt; of the Riley Center in &lt;unk&gt; has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel. The &lt;unk&gt; Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose, but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations. The &lt;unk&gt; Preservation Society was formed in &lt;unk&gt; to raise public awareness and support for the building &lt;unk&gt;s renovation, featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Historic districts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Meridian Downtown Historic District is a combination of two older districts, the Meridian &lt;unk&gt;rban Center Historic District and the &lt;unk&gt;nion Station Historic District. Many architectural styles are present in the districts, most from the late &lt;unk&gt;th and early &lt;unk&gt;th centuries, including &lt;unk&gt;ueen Anne, Colonial Revival, Italianate, Art Deco, Late &lt;unk&gt;ictorian, and &lt;unk&gt;.

The total population increased in each census from the city &lt;unk&gt;s founding until &lt;unk&gt;, although varying from rates as high as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to as low as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In the &lt;unk&gt; census the population decreased, then slightly increased by &lt;unk&gt;, after which the population slowly declined, increasing again since the turn of the &lt;unk&gt;st century. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the population declined more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. As of the census of &lt;unk&gt;, the city &lt;unk&gt;s population was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the population density was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inhabitants per square mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the city was the sixth largest in the state. The population increased as of &lt;unk&gt;. Meridian is the principal city in the Meridian &lt;unk&gt; area, which as of &lt;unk&gt; consisted of three counties &lt;unk&gt; Clarke, &lt;unk&gt;, and Lauderdale &lt;unk&gt; and had a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. There is a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius. While the overall population growth of the city has varied, there has been a steady growth in the number and percentage of non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white residents.

Congregation Beth Israel was founded in &lt;unk&gt;, just before the city &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age. &lt;unk&gt; Meridian once had the largest &lt;unk&gt;ewish community in the state, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ewish people living in the city in &lt;unk&gt;. Today, fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ews live in Meridian, most of whom are elderly. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography and climate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is located in the North Central Hills region of Mississippi in Lauderdale County. According to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is land and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is water. Along major highways, the city is &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;ackson, Mississippi ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; west of Birmingham, Alabama ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Memphis, Tennessee ; and &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; west of Atlanta, Georgia. The area surrounding the city is covered with cotton and corn fields along with oak and pine forests, and its topography consists of clay hills and the bottom lands of the head waters of the &lt;unk&gt; River. The natural terrain of the area has been modified in the urban core of the city by &lt;unk&gt;, but it maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in the northern and southern portions of the city. &lt;unk&gt; Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and branches off into Gallagher &lt;unk&gt;s Creek, which flows through the center of the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Creek runs through the far &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; western part of the city while smaller creeks including Shearer &lt;unk&gt;s Branch, Magnolia Creek, and &lt;unk&gt; Creek are dispersed throughout the city. Meridian is in the humid subtropical climate zone. The average high temperature during summer ( &lt;unk&gt;une through August &lt;unk&gt; is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and the average low is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;. In winter ( December through February &lt;unk&gt; the average maximum is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and minimum &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;.

The average annual precipitation in the city is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, and the wettest month of the year is March, in which an average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of rain falls. Much rainfall is delivered by thunderstorms which are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year. Severe thunderstorms - which can produce damaging winds and &lt;unk&gt; or large hail in addition to the usual &lt;unk&gt; of lightning and heavy rain - occasionally occur. These are most common during the spring months with a secondary peak during the Fall months. These storms also bring the risk of tornadoes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Economy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with five major rail lines and &lt;unk&gt; trains coming in and out daily. The city &lt;unk&gt;s economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about &lt;unk&gt; through &lt;unk&gt;. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the &lt;unk&gt; industry in the &lt;unk&gt;s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people. Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in &lt;unk&gt; by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April &lt;unk&gt;, the city &lt;unk&gt;s civilian labor force was only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people, there is a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. &lt;unk&gt; percent of Lauderdale County &lt;unk&gt;s workers reside in the county while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; live within &lt;unk&gt; miles. In April &lt;unk&gt;, there were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Hospital is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Anderson Hospital with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. There are three hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; related facilities. &lt;unk&gt;eff Anderson Regional Medical Center provides &lt;unk&gt; surgery, a Level II newborn intensive &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; care unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a &lt;unk&gt; Hospital of Meridian, which offers long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term care for non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Riley Hospital has two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since &lt;unk&gt;. Retail is another major employer in the county, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people employed in April &lt;unk&gt;. Nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; square &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lakes Mall offers over one hundred shopping venues, including department stores, specialty shops, restaurants, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;nited Artists &lt;unk&gt;. Phase I of the construction of Meridian Crossroads, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; square &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shopping center in the &lt;unk&gt; Lakes area, was completed in November &lt;unk&gt;, providing a major boost to retail in the area. Also, the shopping district on North Hills Street has continued to expand, and in March &lt;unk&gt;, additional retail and office space was opened near the Highway &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The area is also served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which supply over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; jobs to residents of the surrounding area. &lt;unk&gt; Meridian provides training for naval carrier pilots and other enlisted personnel. Also housed at the base is the Regional Counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Academy ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which provides &lt;unk&gt; training for law enforcement in many southeastern states. &lt;unk&gt; the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state, the city is the leader in a nine county regional response team and a twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; nine county regional response task force. Key Field is the site of the famous flight by brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in &lt;unk&gt;. Key Field is now home to the &lt;unk&gt;th Air &lt;unk&gt; Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the &lt;unk&gt; Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. The site also contains an exhibit reviewing the history of aviation, and is the home of Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s Aviation Museum. The total manufacturing employment of Lauderdale County in April &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Corporation, which has manufactured guitars, &lt;unk&gt;, and sound equipment since &lt;unk&gt;, operates its headquarters in the city. Other businesses in the area include Avery &lt;unk&gt;, Structural Steel Services, Sara Lee, Tower Automotive, and &lt;unk&gt; Corporation. The city is also home to four industrial parks. In downtown, the &lt;unk&gt; Riley Center provides revenue from tourism, arts, and entertainment sales. The Riley Center attracts more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Department Store on Front St has remained a Mississippi clothing landmark, having passed through four generations of family ownership. The store has been selling fine men &lt;unk&gt;s and women &lt;unk&gt;s clothing since &lt;unk&gt;, when the store was first opened by Alex &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Culture &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Arts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Known for more than a century of arts, Meridian contains many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February &lt;unk&gt;. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in &lt;unk&gt;, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in &lt;unk&gt; and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th century portraits, &lt;unk&gt;th century photography, and several sculptures. The Meridian Council for the Arts ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was founded as Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s and Lauderdale County &lt;unk&gt;s official arts agency in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual &lt;unk&gt; Festival, several workshops, and other special events each year. &lt;unk&gt; is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South &lt;unk&gt;s oldest subscription &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based community theatres, was built in &lt;unk&gt; and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guests each season, making it Mississippi &lt;unk&gt;s most &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attended community theatre. The Meridian Symphony Orchestra ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; founded in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; played its first concert in &lt;unk&gt; and its first full season in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; booked its first international soloist, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox &lt;unk&gt;, who has been with the orchestra since &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; will celebrate its &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary in February &lt;unk&gt; with a performance from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The city &lt;unk&gt;s former Grand Opera House was built in &lt;unk&gt; by two half brothers, Israel Marks and Levi &lt;unk&gt;. During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works, the first being a German company &lt;unk&gt;s rendition of &lt;unk&gt;ohann &lt;unk&gt; II &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Baron &lt;unk&gt;. After closing in the late &lt;unk&gt;s due to the Great Depression, the opera house was abandoned for nearly &lt;unk&gt; years. A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million grant in &lt;unk&gt; by the Riley Foundation, a local foundation chartered in &lt;unk&gt;, sparked the building &lt;unk&gt;s restoration while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million came from a combination of city, county, and federal grants. The opera house &lt;unk&gt;s renovation was completed in September &lt;unk&gt; under the new name &lt;unk&gt; Mississippi State &lt;unk&gt;niversity Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts. &lt;unk&gt; The Riley Center, which includes a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seat auditorium for live performances, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seat studio theater, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of meeting space, attracts more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances. Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure &lt;unk&gt; being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century. Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their &lt;unk&gt; due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the &lt;unk&gt;S south designed by noted Canadian born &lt;unk&gt; Louis S. &lt;unk&gt;, famous for &lt;unk&gt; the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed &lt;unk&gt; Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;S and is often compared to Detroit &lt;unk&gt;s famed Fisher Building. Noted California &lt;unk&gt; Wallace &lt;unk&gt; designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which &lt;unk&gt; the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive where his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon &lt;unk&gt;, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph &lt;unk&gt;. One &lt;unk&gt; work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in &lt;unk&gt; and another in Marion Park burned in the &lt;unk&gt;s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and &lt;unk&gt;erde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the &lt;unk&gt;s and originally had &lt;unk&gt; lighting which was removed sadly during a &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; and which are now in private residences on &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive and in North Hills. Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in &lt;unk&gt; and in &lt;unk&gt; promised &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in funding if private contributors could raise &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. The city donated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the cause in September &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;, as proposed, would be located on &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre, an indoor concert hall, and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists. The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana &lt;unk&gt;s building. That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In February &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame. The first star on the walk was dedicated to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a Meridian native. In September of the same year, the second star was revealed, recognizing &lt;unk&gt; King, a famous blues musician from Mississippi. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, authors Tennessee Williams, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and William Faulkner were added to the walk. &lt;unk&gt; Ward was added to the walk on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; plans to add many more Mississippi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born stars to the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman, &lt;unk&gt;immy &lt;unk&gt;, Elvis Presley, Conway &lt;unk&gt;, and others. Another location in the city used for large productions is the &lt;unk&gt; Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater &lt;unk&gt; still in their original installations in the state. With seating for &lt;unk&gt; persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At the time, it was one of the largest stages in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating &lt;unk&gt; persons, the Temple is used year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, &lt;unk&gt; Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies. Highland Park houses a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; museum which displays the original guitar of &lt;unk&gt; The Singing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and other &lt;unk&gt; of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; engine era. In addition to the museum building itself, there are outside memorials, and a vintage steam &lt;unk&gt; on display. A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi. The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta. Also, a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.

The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September &lt;unk&gt;. The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools.

A group of women had formed the &lt;unk&gt; Book and Magazine Club in the &lt;unk&gt;s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at &lt;unk&gt;th Street and &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.

The Church of Scientology has encountered particular &lt;unk&gt; from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal, social and cultural position in Germany. German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or &lt;unk&gt; community, and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions. The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization &lt;unk&gt;s activities. The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion. It views it as an abusive business &lt;unk&gt; as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution. This stance has been criticized, most notably by the &lt;unk&gt;.S. government, which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect &lt;unk&gt;. Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; sect &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to expose a prospective business partner &lt;unk&gt;s or employee &lt;unk&gt;s association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late &lt;unk&gt;, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology, founded in the early &lt;unk&gt;s in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in &lt;unk&gt; countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement. Its stated &lt;unk&gt; aim is to &lt;unk&gt; clear the planet &lt;unk&gt;, to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches that the source of people &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; lies in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, psychological &lt;unk&gt; acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made available by the Church of Scientology. The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for &lt;unk&gt; and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments &lt;unk&gt; it as a profit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; making enterprise rather than as a religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is &lt;unk&gt; a business &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; driven, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, totalitarian ideology with world &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dominating aspirations &lt;unk&gt;, and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought &lt;unk&gt; lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful &lt;unk&gt; Scientology has gained recognition as a tax &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt; won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which &lt;unk&gt; Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion. The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a &lt;unk&gt; commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism &lt;unk&gt; whose &lt;unk&gt; totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany &lt;unk&gt;s democratic society &lt;unk&gt;. Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October &lt;unk&gt;, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether. Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the &lt;unk&gt;K. On the subject of Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s status as a religion, the German government has pointed to a &lt;unk&gt; decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany. That court, noting Hubbard &lt;unk&gt;s instruction that Scientologists should &lt;unk&gt; make money, make more money &lt;unk&gt; make other people produce so as to make more money &lt;unk&gt;, came to the conclusion that &lt;unk&gt; Scientology &lt;unk&gt; to be a &lt;unk&gt; church &lt;unk&gt; merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests &lt;unk&gt;. In the same decision, the court also found that Scientology uses &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and totalitarian practices &lt;unk&gt;. Given the lessons of Germany &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century history, in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings, Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power. &lt;unk&gt; in Scientology writings to the elimination of &lt;unk&gt; parasites &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; world &lt;unk&gt; without &lt;unk&gt;, without criminals and without war &lt;unk&gt; evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism, and have led to Scientology being classified as an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; political movement &lt;unk&gt;. To further justify its stance, the German government has also pointed to the long history of &lt;unk&gt;.S. court cases involving Scientology, including the conviction of &lt;unk&gt; top Scientologists in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of &lt;unk&gt;.S. government agencies, &lt;unk&gt; and the theft of government documents, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; environment &lt;unk&gt;, and Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators. In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are &lt;unk&gt; structured so as to make the individual &lt;unk&gt; and financially dependent on a Scientology system &lt;unk&gt;, and that members often abandon contact with friends and family. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology presence in Germany &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology first became active in Germany in &lt;unk&gt;. By &lt;unk&gt;, there were ten major centres ( &lt;unk&gt; Scientology Churches &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as well as fourteen minor centres ( &lt;unk&gt; Scientology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Germany. The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities &lt;unk&gt; Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, D&lt;unk&gt;sseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hanover and &lt;unk&gt;. Of the Scientology &lt;unk&gt;, nine are in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and three in &lt;unk&gt;. Following German re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and North &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Rhine &lt;unk&gt;. Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or &lt;unk&gt; in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Germany &lt;unk&gt;s domestic intelligence service, the &lt;unk&gt; f&lt;unk&gt;r &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution &lt;unk&gt;, estimates that there are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Church of Scientology reported around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; members from the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; members. &lt;unk&gt; in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of &lt;unk&gt; bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred. Scientology formulated a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Germany &lt;unk&gt; strategy in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world &lt;unk&gt; with the long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term aim of transforming German society in line with the &lt;unk&gt; ideal : a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; society in which Scientology enjoys &lt;unk&gt; influence. The programme sought to address Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s image problems in Germany, to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain, such as Germany &lt;unk&gt;s National Socialist history, and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society, with a special emphasis on &lt;unk&gt; Scientologists into key positions in in</td>\n",

He made his acting debut at &lt;unk&gt; years of age in BBC One &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; television film David Copperfield, followed by his cinematic debut in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s The &lt;unk&gt; of Panama. At age &lt;unk&gt;, he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film, and starred in the series for &lt;unk&gt; years until the release of the eighth and final film in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; began to branch out to stage acting in &lt;unk&gt;, starring in the London and New York productions of &lt;unk&gt;, and in the &lt;unk&gt; Broadway revival of the musical How to &lt;unk&gt; in Business Without Really &lt;unk&gt;. He starred in the &lt;unk&gt; horror film The Woman in Black, and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the &lt;unk&gt; independent film Kill Your &lt;unk&gt;. He has contributed to many charities, including &lt;unk&gt; Hospice Care for Children, and The Trevor Project for suicide prevention among &lt;unk&gt; youth, which gave him its Hero Award in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was born in West London, England. He is the only child of Alan George &lt;unk&gt;, a literary agent, and Marcia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( n&lt;unk&gt;e Marcia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;acobson &lt;unk&gt;, a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector &lt;unk&gt; Mysteries and Walk Away and I &lt;unk&gt;. His father, who was raised in &lt;unk&gt;, County Down, Northern Ireland, is from &lt;unk&gt; a very working &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class &lt;unk&gt; Protestant background. His mother is &lt;unk&gt;ewish, and was born in South Africa and raised in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Sea, Essex. Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parents had both acted as children. In a &lt;unk&gt; interview, &lt;unk&gt; stated : &lt;unk&gt; There was never &lt;unk&gt; religious &lt;unk&gt; faith in the house. I think of myself as being &lt;unk&gt;ewish and Irish, despite the fact that I &lt;unk&gt;m English. &lt;unk&gt; He has stated : &lt;unk&gt; We were Christmas tree &lt;unk&gt;ews &lt;unk&gt;, and that he is &lt;unk&gt; very proud of being &lt;unk&gt;ewish &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; first expressed a desire to act at the age of five, and in December &lt;unk&gt;, aged &lt;unk&gt;, he made his acting debut in BBC One &lt;unk&gt;s televised two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at two independent schools for boys : Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London &lt;unk&gt;s financial district ( known as the City of London &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; school became difficult for &lt;unk&gt; after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to &lt;unk&gt; have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt; rather than jealousy. As his acting career began to consume his schedule, &lt;unk&gt; continued his education through on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work &lt;unk&gt; really difficult. &lt;unk&gt; He achieved A grades in the three &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level exams that he took in &lt;unk&gt;, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;, they &lt;unk&gt;d love it, &lt;unk&gt; he told Details magazine in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; If there were any parties going on, they &lt;unk&gt;d be tipped off as to where they were. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, producer David &lt;unk&gt; asked &lt;unk&gt; to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone, the best &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; selling book by British author &lt;unk&gt;. K. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had been searching for an unknown British actor to &lt;unk&gt; the character, and the movie &lt;unk&gt;s director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, &lt;unk&gt; This is what I want. This is Harry Potter &lt;unk&gt;, after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, and after several auditions, &lt;unk&gt; was selected to play the part. &lt;unk&gt; also endorsed the selection saying, &lt;unk&gt; I don &lt;unk&gt;t think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered &lt;unk&gt; a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; movie contract with shooting in the &lt;unk&gt;K ; &lt;unk&gt; was unsure at the time if he would do any more than that. The release of Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Stone in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; took place in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; received a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was &lt;unk&gt; not that important &lt;unk&gt; to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the embodiment of every reader &lt;unk&gt;s imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing, &lt;unk&gt; wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle. A year later &lt;unk&gt; starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of &lt;unk&gt;, the second installment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors &lt;unk&gt; performances but had &lt;unk&gt; opinions on the movie as a whole. The &lt;unk&gt; release Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; was the third film in the series. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; of Fire in &lt;unk&gt;. The film was the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and &lt;unk&gt; singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie &lt;unk&gt;s creative success. The future of the franchise was put into question when &lt;unk&gt; and his co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; leads Emma Watson and Rupert &lt;unk&gt; hesitated signing on to continue their roles for the final two episodes ; however, by March &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had signed for the final films, which put an end to weeks of press &lt;unk&gt; speculation that he would be denied the role due to his involvement in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which he had performed nude on stage. &lt;unk&gt; reprised his role for the fourth time in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; stated that director David &lt;unk&gt; and actress &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made Order of the Phoenix the &lt;unk&gt; most fun &lt;unk&gt; film in the series to work on. His performance earned several award nominations, and he received the &lt;unk&gt; National Movie Award for &lt;unk&gt; Best Male Performance. &lt;unk&gt; As his fame and the series continued, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Watson left &lt;unk&gt; of their hands, feet, and &lt;unk&gt; in front of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; Harry Potter and the Half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Blood Prince was released, the series &lt;unk&gt; sixth instalment. &lt;unk&gt; received nominations for &lt;unk&gt; Best Male Performance &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Global &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; MT&lt;unk&gt; Movie Awards. For financial and &lt;unk&gt; reasons the last book was divided into two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series &lt;unk&gt; fanbase. &lt;unk&gt; defended the split, stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more &lt;unk&gt;, focusing on character development ; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, &lt;unk&gt; openly &lt;unk&gt;. The final film, Harry Potter and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Part &lt;unk&gt;, was released in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, along with the film, was critically acclaimed : Ann &lt;unk&gt; of The Washington Post asked, &lt;unk&gt; Who could have predicted that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Watson would turn out to be good actors? &lt;unk&gt; ; similarly, Rex Reed said : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, I ’ m sorry to see &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; go &lt;unk&gt; ; while Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers commented on &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Well played, sir. &lt;unk&gt; Roger &lt;unk&gt; gave the film a highly positive review, but felt that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Watson were &lt;unk&gt; upstaged by the supporting &lt;unk&gt; actors &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character, but also said he is &lt;unk&gt; proud to be associated with this film series forever. &lt;unk&gt; Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After &lt;unk&gt; hinted about writing an eighth book, &lt;unk&gt; was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; It is &lt;unk&gt; very doubtful. I think &lt;unk&gt; years is a long time to spend with one character. &lt;unk&gt; Despite &lt;unk&gt; so much time to the series, &lt;unk&gt; has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : &lt;unk&gt; I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made his film debut in The &lt;unk&gt; of Panama, an American &lt;unk&gt; film based on &lt;unk&gt;ohn le &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In &lt;unk&gt; he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I &lt;unk&gt;, directed by Kenneth Branagh &lt;unk&gt; who also appeared with him in the second Harry Potter film. In &lt;unk&gt; he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in &lt;unk&gt; and released to theatres in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Also in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; starred with Carey &lt;unk&gt; in My Boy &lt;unk&gt;ack, a television drama film shown on IT&lt;unk&gt; on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance as an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old who goes missing in action during a battle. &lt;unk&gt; stated, &lt;unk&gt; For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I &lt;unk&gt;ve always been fascinated by the subject and think it &lt;unk&gt;s as relevant today as it ever was. &lt;unk&gt; At age &lt;unk&gt;, in a bid to show people he was prepared for adult roles, he performed onstage in Peter Shaffer &lt;unk&gt;s play &lt;unk&gt;, which had not been revived since its first run in &lt;unk&gt;, at the Gielgud Theatre. &lt;unk&gt; took on the lead role as Alan &lt;unk&gt;, a stable boy who has an obsession with horses. Advance sales topped &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, and the role generated significant pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; opening media interest, as &lt;unk&gt; appeared in a nude scene. &lt;unk&gt; opened on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; and ran until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance received positive reviews as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; type role. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote that he &lt;unk&gt; displays a dramatic power and an &lt;unk&gt; stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward. &lt;unk&gt; He added : &lt;unk&gt; I never thought I would find the &lt;unk&gt; ( but perfectly formed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a sinister figure, but as Alan &lt;unk&gt;... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion. &lt;unk&gt; The production then transferred to Broadway in September &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; still in the lead role. &lt;unk&gt; stated he was nervous about repeating the role on Broadway because he considered American audiences more discerning than those in London. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was nominated for a Drama &lt;unk&gt; Award. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; debuted as &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Finch in the &lt;unk&gt; Broadway revival How to &lt;unk&gt; in Business Without Really &lt;unk&gt;, a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert &lt;unk&gt; and Matthew &lt;unk&gt;. Other cast members included &lt;unk&gt;ohn Larroquette, Rose &lt;unk&gt; and Mary &lt;unk&gt;. Both the actor and production received favourable reviews, with &lt;unk&gt;SA Today commenting : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ultimately succeeds not by &lt;unk&gt; his fellow cast members, but by working in conscientious harmony with them &lt;unk&gt; and having a blast in the process. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance in the show earned him Drama &lt;unk&gt; Award, Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations. The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations. &lt;unk&gt; left the show on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. His first post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Harry Potter project was the &lt;unk&gt; horror film The Woman in Black, adapted from the &lt;unk&gt; novel by Susan Hill. The film was released on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States and Canada, and was released on &lt;unk&gt; February in the &lt;unk&gt;K. &lt;unk&gt; portrays a man sent to deal with the legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died, and soon after he begins to experience strange events and &lt;unk&gt; from the ghost of a woman dressed in black.

Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; is the fifth episode of the third season of the American crime &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; thriller television series Millennium. It premiered on the Fox network on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode was written by Michael R. Perry, and directed by Thomas &lt;unk&gt;. Wright. &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; featured guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss, performing both as themselves and as minor characters. In this episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Emma Hollis ( &lt;unk&gt; Scott &lt;unk&gt; investigate a series of murders on the set of a horror film &lt;unk&gt; and realize that the production is based on a case Black solved several years earlier. &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; proved a difficult episode to produce, with filming requiring a large number of shots to be completed and the script to be adjusted on short notice. It has evoked mixed responses from critics, although the guest appearances by the members of Kiss have been more universally criticized. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Emma Hollis ( &lt;unk&gt; Scott &lt;unk&gt; travel to &lt;unk&gt; Rest, South Carolina to investigate the deaths of film director Lew Carroll ( Paul Stanley &lt;unk&gt; and Marta &lt;unk&gt;, the leading actress in his newest film. As the local sheriff guides Black and Hollis through the murder scene, Black realizes that the film is based on a real murder case he investigated thirteen years previously ; he is shocked to learn that the true story is being &lt;unk&gt; for the screen. The pair interview the cast and crew as suspects, discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths &lt;unk&gt; producer Kenny &lt;unk&gt; had been having an affair with &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced Carroll as director ; Ruby Dahl and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, whose roles in the film will expand without &lt;unk&gt; ; and Mark Bianco, a method actor &lt;unk&gt; the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a &lt;unk&gt; production. The production continues, and after the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering ; &lt;unk&gt; discovers a severed finger in his sandwich, recognizing from its ring that it belonged to &lt;unk&gt;. When the sheriff &lt;unk&gt; down production, Black &lt;unk&gt; that the killer may target the crew &lt;unk&gt;s hotel ; he and Hollis arrive to find the body of the film &lt;unk&gt;s publicist hanging from a rope. The next day, a film extra ( Gene Simmons &lt;unk&gt; confesses to the killings ; Black &lt;unk&gt; holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator. Regardless, production is resumed &lt;unk&gt; and shortly afterwards, several crew members are found with their &lt;unk&gt; cut, while Winston &lt;unk&gt;s body hangs nearby in an apparent murder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; suicide. Black doubts that Winston is the killer, and while Hollis stays in the hotel, he visits the production &lt;unk&gt;s climactic shoot, set during a performance by the band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff &lt;unk&gt;s body is thrown down from the &lt;unk&gt; ; as the &lt;unk&gt; settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted &lt;unk&gt; the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis &lt;unk&gt; off a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; ; the actor then explains that he lacked Black &lt;unk&gt;s insight and had to commit the crimes in order to see through the eyes of a killer. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry, who had previously penned the second season episode &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and would provide a further three scripts in the third season. The episode was directed by Thomas &lt;unk&gt;. Wright, who helmed a total of twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; six episodes across all three seasons. Wright would also go on to direct &lt;unk&gt; Millennium &lt;unk&gt;, the series &lt;unk&gt; crossover episode with its sister show The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files. The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss &lt;unk&gt; Peter Criss, Ace &lt;unk&gt;, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley &lt;unk&gt; who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role. However, the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue, which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and &lt;unk&gt; updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode. Ace &lt;unk&gt; was also &lt;unk&gt; towards his role, and requested to play a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pound black man &lt;unk&gt; instead, wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the &lt;unk&gt; Eddie Murphy film The &lt;unk&gt; Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to &lt;unk&gt;. Perry has described the production &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; as being &lt;unk&gt; one of the most &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the series &lt;unk&gt; run, citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this. Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints, as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode. Guest star &lt;unk&gt;eff &lt;unk&gt;, who played killer Mark Bianco, is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher, who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black &lt;unk&gt;s wife Catherine. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Broadcast and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; was first broadcast on the Fox network on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; during its original broadcast, meaning that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent of households in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States viewed the episode. This represented approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million households. &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from critics. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club &lt;unk&gt;s Todd &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff rated the episode a &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff felt that the episode &lt;unk&gt;s comedic &lt;unk&gt; was necessary within the wider series, as he considered Millennium &lt;unk&gt;s dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this. &lt;unk&gt;anDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when &lt;unk&gt; the character of Frank Black, but admitted that it &lt;unk&gt; falls apart &lt;unk&gt; when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files, Millennium &lt;unk&gt; The Lone Gunmen, rated &lt;unk&gt;... Thirteen Years Later &lt;unk&gt; one star out of five. Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better, but that &lt;unk&gt; the whole concept drowns in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He considered the episode &lt;unk&gt;s characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss.  &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus, known as the European lobster or common lobster, is a species of &lt;unk&gt; lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is closely related to the American lobster, H. americanus. It may grow to a length of &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and a mass of &lt;unk&gt; kilograms ( &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;, and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life, the lobsters are blue, only becoming &lt;unk&gt; lobster red &lt;unk&gt; on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into &lt;unk&gt; larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around the British Isles. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is a large &lt;unk&gt;, with a body length up to &lt;unk&gt; centimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and weighing up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilograms ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;, although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; long and weigh &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lb &lt;unk&gt;. Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard &lt;unk&gt; which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; years for larger animals. The first pair of &lt;unk&gt; is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of claws. The larger one is the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and has rounded &lt;unk&gt; used for crushing prey ; the other is the &lt;unk&gt; cutter &lt;unk&gt;, which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. &lt;unk&gt;sually, the left claw is the &lt;unk&gt;, and the right is the cutter. The &lt;unk&gt; is generally blue above, with spots that &lt;unk&gt;, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment &lt;unk&gt; is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : The &lt;unk&gt; of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Life cycle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size. Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently &lt;unk&gt; female, whose shell is therefore soft, and a hard &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shelled male. The female carries the eggs for up to &lt;unk&gt; months, depending on the temperature, attached to her &lt;unk&gt;. Females carrying eggs are said to be &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and can be found throughout the year. The eggs hatch at night, and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on &lt;unk&gt;. This stage involves three &lt;unk&gt; and lasts for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a &lt;unk&gt; lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only &lt;unk&gt; larva in every &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; survives to the &lt;unk&gt; phase. When they reach a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Distribution &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is found across the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco, not including the Baltic Sea. It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea, only missing from the section east of Crete, and along only the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west coast of the Black Sea. The &lt;unk&gt; populations are found in the Norwegian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, inside the Arctic Circle. The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment. The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway, which have been referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; midnight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sun lobster &lt;unk&gt;. The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean. The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the &lt;unk&gt; were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel. Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European species such as the edible crab, Cancer &lt;unk&gt;. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, one million lobster larvae were released from &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, but the species did not become established there. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ecology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;, although not normally deeper than &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. They prefer hard substrates, such as rocks or hard mud, and live in holes or crevices, emerging at night to feed. The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other &lt;unk&gt; invertebrates. These include crabs, molluscs, sea &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and polychaete worms. The three &lt;unk&gt; lobster species Homarus gammarus, H. americanus and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are hosts to the three known species of the animal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described. Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease &lt;unk&gt;, caused by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although it is frequently found in American lobsters, the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus, where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Human consumption &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus is traditionally &lt;unk&gt; highly esteemed &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; and was mentioned in &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain &lt;unk&gt; excellent &lt;unk&gt; white meat, and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the &lt;unk&gt; mill and the &lt;unk&gt; sand vein &lt;unk&gt; ( gut &lt;unk&gt;. The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus, and the European species is considered to have a better flavour. &lt;unk&gt; are mostly fished using lobster pots, although lines &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; sometimes succeed in tempting them out, to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands &lt;unk&gt;. The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; systems for H. gammarus are under development, and production rates are still very low. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. That name was Cancer gammarus, since Linnaeus &lt;unk&gt; concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans. H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber, &lt;unk&gt;, as determined by Direction &lt;unk&gt; of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. Prior to that direction, confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Edwards, &lt;unk&gt;, and also because Friedrich Weber &lt;unk&gt;s description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary &lt;unk&gt;, rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Edwards, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; invalid for Homarus Weber, &lt;unk&gt;. The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a &lt;unk&gt; selected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. It came from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; N &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E, near &lt;unk&gt;, Sweden ( &lt;unk&gt; kilometres or &lt;unk&gt; miles northwest of Gothenburg &lt;unk&gt;, but both it and the &lt;unk&gt; have since been lost. The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is &lt;unk&gt; European lobster &lt;unk&gt;, but the species is also widely known as the &lt;unk&gt; common lobster &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; assassination plot &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; assassination plot was a conspiracy by a group of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking followers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( later known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to assassinate Charles Turner, the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;nited States Attorney for the District of Oregon. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s personal secretary and second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; Silverman &lt;unk&gt;, assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at &lt;unk&gt;. Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and &lt;unk&gt; marriages, and later headed the federal prosecution of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. The conspirators included : Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt;, Chief Financial Officer of &lt;unk&gt; ; Susan &lt;unk&gt;, head of security at &lt;unk&gt;, Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt;, who bought weapons and &lt;unk&gt; and volunteered to be the actual murderer ; Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy, fourth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command of &lt;unk&gt; ; and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conspirators Alma Potter, Carol Matthews, &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt;. The conspirators obtained false identification to purchase &lt;unk&gt; out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; state, &lt;unk&gt; Turner, and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland, Oregon. The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later, as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt; and other illegal acts by the &lt;unk&gt; leadership. Prosecution of the conspirators began in &lt;unk&gt;, when a federal grand jury brought &lt;unk&gt; against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and &lt;unk&gt; proceedings against the &lt;unk&gt; and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years. The final &lt;unk&gt; was convicted in &lt;unk&gt;, when Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; agreed to return to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight &lt;unk&gt; received sentences ranging from five years &lt;unk&gt; to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; was never &lt;unk&gt; in relation to the conspiracy, and left the &lt;unk&gt;nited States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to &lt;unk&gt; the country without permission from the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney General. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Planning &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hit list &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seven followers ( called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of charismatic leader &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( now known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were convicted of a &lt;unk&gt; conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional &lt;unk&gt; eighth member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The &lt;unk&gt; were high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking followers within the &lt;unk&gt; organization. &lt;unk&gt; in the case stated that the &lt;unk&gt; had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group &lt;unk&gt;s activities in &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. Turner &lt;unk&gt;s investigation focused on &lt;unk&gt; marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave &lt;unk&gt; was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner. In May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s personal secretary and second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, &lt;unk&gt; Silverman ( Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, gathered the leader &lt;unk&gt;s key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of Turner, as well as several dissidents among their organization. &lt;unk&gt; stated that Turner &lt;unk&gt;s grand jury investigation &lt;unk&gt; threatened the existence of the commune &lt;unk&gt;, and exposed &lt;unk&gt; and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution. &lt;unk&gt; hoped that by murdering Turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; leaders. Three former leaders of the commune including Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Yvonne &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a registered nurse from the Philippines who managed the &lt;unk&gt; medical corporation, and former treasurer of &lt;unk&gt; Foundation International and Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Australia, put together a hit list which included &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David &lt;unk&gt;. Susan &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma Anand Su &lt;unk&gt;, a top official in the &lt;unk&gt; hierarchy, was also a participant in the assassination conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; was in charge of the security force at &lt;unk&gt;, ran the &lt;unk&gt; Investment Corporation, and supervised construction on the commune. Other conspirators in the assassination plot included Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, president of the &lt;unk&gt; commune, and Alma Potter ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bodyguard and traveling companion. Potter was manager of the Hotel &lt;unk&gt; in Portland, Oregon, and a member of the commune &lt;unk&gt;s security force. The &lt;unk&gt; reported that nine people were on the hit list, including : Turner, &lt;unk&gt;, former assistant attorney general Karen H. Green, &lt;unk&gt; County planning director Daniel C. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; County commissioner &lt;unk&gt;ames L. &lt;unk&gt;, investigative journalist for The &lt;unk&gt; Leslie L. &lt;unk&gt;, former member Helen C. Byron ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who had been awarded &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in a lawsuit against &lt;unk&gt; Foundation International, her daughter Barbara &lt;unk&gt;. Byron ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former secretary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Weapons &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder Turner, and bought guns and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was known to fellow followers as Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and was also one of the three &lt;unk&gt; Big &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; ( known by followers as Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an &lt;unk&gt; and the group &lt;unk&gt;s Chief Financial Officer, provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell ( Ma Deva &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; described in a federal &lt;unk&gt; how members of the murder conspiracy obtained &lt;unk&gt;, referring to Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B went down to &lt;unk&gt;esus Grove, and &lt;unk&gt; gave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;esus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the &lt;unk&gt; commune resided, except for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; and three other &lt;unk&gt; followers traveled to New York in the spring of &lt;unk&gt; to acquire false identification. According to a federal &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns. Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase &lt;unk&gt;. Caldwell stated she and Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; flew to Texas to purchase guns there. They purchased five guns in Texas, but encountered difficulty purchasing &lt;unk&gt; in Texas with out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead. Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed &lt;unk&gt; not to come back without the guns &lt;unk&gt;. In New Mexico, they obtained false identification, and purchased several pistols. Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico : &lt;unk&gt; we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell said she and &lt;unk&gt; went to a university library to find the identity &lt;unk&gt; of someone dying very young &lt;unk&gt;, next went &lt;unk&gt; to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate &lt;unk&gt; and described how &lt;unk&gt; we got a rent &lt;unk&gt; book and just made up a rent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in &lt;unk&gt; with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets, &lt;unk&gt; said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; caliber revolver, and four &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; caliber Security &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Six Magnum &lt;unk&gt;. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a &lt;unk&gt; Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and &lt;unk&gt; traveled by bus back to the &lt;unk&gt; commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland, Oregon. They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner. &lt;unk&gt; follower Carol Matthews ( Ma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot, in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner. According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college &lt;unk&gt; of Turner &lt;unk&gt;s, and learned his car &lt;unk&gt;s license plate number and his parking location. Court records state that Matthews and an &lt;unk&gt; co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gave &lt;unk&gt; registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; survey on President Reagan &lt;unk&gt;s economic plan &lt;unk&gt;, in order to obtain Turner &lt;unk&gt;s route number and post office box number. The two tried repeating the story with members of the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Postal Service, but the postal officials did not give them Turner &lt;unk&gt;s address. They then drove around Turner &lt;unk&gt;s neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said &lt;unk&gt; Turner &lt;unk&gt;. Matthews had pictures of Turner &lt;unk&gt;s residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI &lt;unk&gt; during an investigation of the &lt;unk&gt; commune, and verified after being shown to Turner. Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner &lt;unk&gt;s office, home and car, and discussed methods to assassinate him, hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into &lt;unk&gt;. Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked, in Portland, Oregon, but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home. After spending multiple nights watching Turner &lt;unk&gt;s house, the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work, or in front of his home. Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry &lt;unk&gt; Plaza in Portland, Oregon. In an &lt;unk&gt; given to the FBI, &lt;unk&gt; Alma &lt;unk&gt; described how the &lt;unk&gt; decided on the federal parking garage as the location : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off. &lt;unk&gt; The conspirators practiced different ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. &lt;unk&gt; later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; if the plan was successful. According to The &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; were not carried out because Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; became distracted by political power plays within the &lt;unk&gt; commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Investigation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Congressman &lt;unk&gt;ames H. Weaver gave a speech in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States House of Representatives in which he asserted that the &lt;unk&gt; were involved in the &lt;unk&gt; attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a &lt;unk&gt;efferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement as a result of the ensuing investigation into activities at &lt;unk&gt;. Turner was never physically &lt;unk&gt;, and had retired by &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; was informed in October &lt;unk&gt; by federal law enforcement officials that Leslie L. &lt;unk&gt;, an investigative journalist who had written a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part series on the &lt;unk&gt; movement in Oregon, was on a &lt;unk&gt; hit list &lt;unk&gt; which also included Turner and Oregon Attorney General David &lt;unk&gt;. Assistant &lt;unk&gt;.S. Attorney Robert Weaver &lt;unk&gt; the case ; the charges were first detailed at an October &lt;unk&gt; bond hearing in North Carolina after &lt;unk&gt; and his followers were arrested at an airport in Charlotte. Weaver said in court that followers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had plotted to assassinate Turner and &lt;unk&gt;. He said these allegations were reasons why releasing &lt;unk&gt; and his followers from jail would be &lt;unk&gt; a clear and present danger to public officials &lt;unk&gt;. The guns purchased by the &lt;unk&gt; followers for the assassination plot had reportedly been dumped in a lake at Rancho &lt;unk&gt; ; the lake was searched by &lt;unk&gt;.S. Navy divers. &lt;unk&gt; divers searched the lake for two days but did not find the guns. &lt;unk&gt;oseph Greene, a &lt;unk&gt;.S. immigration agent, testified in court that FBI agents had learned of the assassination plot from a member of the organization who was in a witness protection program. Greene said that members involved in the assassination plot included Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Yvonne &lt;unk&gt;, and Alma &lt;unk&gt;. The assassination plot was investigated by the FBI and the Oregon State Police. &lt;unk&gt; told law enforcement that Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; hoped Turner &lt;unk&gt;s death would prevent an Immigration and &lt;unk&gt; Service investigation which she thought could lead to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s arrest and &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Weaver stated &lt;unk&gt; These attempts to assassinate public officials were because they were presenting an immigration case that might result in imprisonment &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; There were not simply plans, but at least one ( assassination &lt;unk&gt; attempt, &lt;unk&gt; said Weaver at the hearing. A grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of &lt;unk&gt; widespread immigration fraud &lt;unk&gt; against members of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; crimes were discovered after Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; had fled the commune in September &lt;unk&gt;. In December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; followers of &lt;unk&gt; were indicted on &lt;unk&gt; charges. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and convictions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chief criminal assistant &lt;unk&gt;.S. attorney Baron C. &lt;unk&gt; was assigned to &lt;unk&gt; the charges of federal &lt;unk&gt;, and a special team from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Department of &lt;unk&gt;ustice Criminal Division was tasked with &lt;unk&gt; the murder conspiracy charges. Four of the &lt;unk&gt; were arrested in September &lt;unk&gt;. Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; were arrested in West Germany, Ann &lt;unk&gt; McCarthy was arrested in South Africa, and Susan &lt;unk&gt; was arrested in England. In September &lt;unk&gt;, Alma &lt;unk&gt; pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder. &lt;unk&gt;, who had served as Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bodyguard and &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to testify against the other defendants in the murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt;nder the terms of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plea agreement she received a sentence of two years in federal prison. Carol Matthews was arrested in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Baden, Germany in October &lt;unk&gt; on charges of &lt;unk&gt; and conspiracy to murder Turner, where she was held along with three other &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of her arrest, Matthews was found in possession of a false British passport, and had been traveling under the fake name of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; were brought against Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; and six other co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conspirators by a federal grand jury in November &lt;unk&gt;. In April &lt;unk&gt;, Carol Matthews and Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; from Germany to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in order to appear in federal court in Portland, Oregon. Law enforcement officials from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Service traveled to Frankfurt, Germany and took custody of the Matthews and &lt;unk&gt; at Rhine Main Airport. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Matthews and &lt;unk&gt; appeared in federal court in Oregon, and both pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy to commit murder and carrying out &lt;unk&gt;. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt; pleaded guilty in federal court to participating in the murder conspiracy plot against Turner, and in exchange he received a sentence of five years in federal prison and the dismissal of other charges against him relating to firearms and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; agreed to testify against the other members of the murder conspiracy. &lt;unk&gt; wrote on his plea agreement form : &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, meetings were held at the Rancho &lt;unk&gt;... at which time the possible killing of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Attorney for Oregon was discussed. I participated in a number of these meetings and agreed with others to work toward that object. &lt;unk&gt; Prosecutor Timothy &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; III stated that &lt;unk&gt; had been a member of the &lt;unk&gt; commune in Oregon since it began in &lt;unk&gt;, and that the government was able to prove he joined the murder conspiracy at a point in time after May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; said that &lt;unk&gt; was a member of a group called the &lt;unk&gt; Circle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was the personal security force that guarded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and that he had served as a weapons instructor and policeman at the commune. &lt;unk&gt; told &lt;unk&gt;.S. District &lt;unk&gt;udge Malcom F. Marsh that he had suggested that guns for the murder conspiracy could be bought in Texas, instructed the &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt;, took responsibility for the weapons while they were in the commune, and disposed of them when members of the murder conspiracy decided to flee the &lt;unk&gt;.S. for Europe. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, Carol Matthews entered a guilty plea and was convicted in federal court, she was sentenced to five years in prison. Catherine &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; was convicted of the attempted murder of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s physician Dr. George Meredith ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and served almost three years in jail. After her release, agents from the FBI uncovered the plot to assassinate Turner, but &lt;unk&gt; had already fled to Germany. She was indicted by a federal grand jury in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the German government refused to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; back to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.S. prosecutors filed &lt;unk&gt; in the murder conspiracy case with the Higher Regional Court in &lt;unk&gt;, Germany, as part of an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; from Germany to the &lt;unk&gt;.S. The &lt;unk&gt; stated that all of the members in the murder conspiracy plot also belonged to a group of &lt;unk&gt; followers at the Oregon commune known as &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and were trained in &lt;unk&gt; commando tactics using &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rifles and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. David Berry Knapp ( known to &lt;unk&gt; followers as &lt;unk&gt; Krishna Deva &lt;unk&gt; stated in an FBI &lt;unk&gt; that the murder conspiracy was motivated by Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; tremendous anger &lt;unk&gt; towards Turner. Ma Anand &lt;unk&gt; served &lt;unk&gt; months in a minimum security federal prison for charges related to assault, attempted murder, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attack in The &lt;unk&gt;, and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in &lt;unk&gt;. The assassination conspiracy was discovered after &lt;unk&gt; had left the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and as of &lt;unk&gt; she was still wanted by federal law enforcement for her role in the plot, and risked &lt;unk&gt; if she crossed the Swiss border. Switzerland declined an &lt;unk&gt; request from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and instead tried her in a Swiss court. &lt;unk&gt; was found guilty of &lt;unk&gt; criminal acts preparatory to the commission of murder &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and sentenced to time already served. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Anne &lt;unk&gt; and Susan &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; from Britain in &lt;unk&gt;, and were convicted by a jury decision on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; for their roles in the assassination plot. They had unsuccessfully attempted to appeal their &lt;unk&gt; from Britain to Home Secretary Michael Howard. During their trial the prosecution presented twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; nine witnesses, including former followers of &lt;unk&gt; who placed both women in planning meetings where they discussed murdering Turner. David Berry Knapp, the former mayor of &lt;unk&gt;, testified for the government in the case and implicated &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in the assassination conspiracy. Ava Kay &lt;unk&gt; ( Ma Ava &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; disciple, testified in the &lt;unk&gt; case and stated that she had been part of the conspirators that plotted to assassinate Turner. In addition to Knapp and &lt;unk&gt;, co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conspirators Richard Kevin &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell, and Alma &lt;unk&gt; testified in the case pursuant to conditional plea or immunity agreements. Both women were sentenced to five years in prison. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; did not testify during their trial. &lt;unk&gt; We &lt;unk&gt; over everything &lt;unk&gt; evidence, notes, evidence, notes. I think we did an absolutely fabulous job, &lt;unk&gt; said one of the jurors. At the sentencing for &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the federal &lt;unk&gt;udge Malcolm Marsh described them as &lt;unk&gt; people of obvious goodwill who had committed an extremely serious offense against the criminal justice system. &lt;unk&gt; Prosecutor Tim &lt;unk&gt; called the conspiracy to commit assassination &lt;unk&gt; a deadly serious crime aimed at the heart of the criminal justice system. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were released from imprisonment at &lt;unk&gt; Dublin, California in April &lt;unk&gt;, and returned to Britain.

In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, &lt;unk&gt; also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years &lt;unk&gt;, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a &lt;unk&gt; sentence, and commented &lt;unk&gt; This was a lying &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, and for a long time I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed. &lt;unk&gt; Though &lt;unk&gt; could have faced life in prison, &lt;unk&gt;.S.

Marsh thought she had &lt;unk&gt; seen the error of her ways. &lt;unk&gt; A federal prosecutor in the case described &lt;unk&gt; as the &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, &lt;unk&gt; stated : &lt;unk&gt; I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner, it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth... No person has the right to do what I did.

Starting on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the tour spanned five shows in Asia, six in Australia, and one in Hawaii, &lt;unk&gt;S.

In fact, she had not embarked on a tour until her third studio effort, Music Box ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, when she performed six arena shows in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States during the Music Box Tour. The opening night of the tour received scathing reviews, mostly aimed at Carey &lt;unk&gt;s deemed &lt;unk&gt; obvious &lt;unk&gt; stage &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and failure to make a connection with the crowd. &lt;unk&gt; nights were more favorably reviewed, with critics raving about Carey &lt;unk&gt;s vocals. &lt;unk&gt;on Pareles of The New York Times wrote regarding Carey &lt;unk&gt;s live vocals, &lt;unk&gt; Beyond any doubt, Ms. Carey &lt;unk&gt;s voice is no studio &lt;unk&gt;. Her range extends from a rich, &lt;unk&gt; alto to dog &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; whistle high notes ; she can linger over sensual turns, &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; confidence, &lt;unk&gt; like a &lt;unk&gt; singer. &lt;unk&gt; However, after the strong media attention, Carey did not visit the &lt;unk&gt;S on her succeeding Daydream World Tour in &lt;unk&gt;, visiting only Europe and Asia. The tour in contrast, received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike, as well as breaking ticket sale records. Carey &lt;unk&gt;s three shows at &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s largest stadium, Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, sold out in under three hours, &lt;unk&gt; in over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets, setting the record of fastest show &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s history. On the Butterfly World Tour, Carey broke the record, selling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets in under one hour. During &lt;unk&gt;, after the commercially and critically successful release of Butterfly, Carey had not planned to tour once again, due to the long travel times and strain on her voice. However, due to overwhelming demand by fans, Carey agreed to perform in Asia once again, only extending the tour to Taiwan and Australia, as well as one last show in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. &lt;unk&gt; for the show began shortly after Christmas &lt;unk&gt;, extending for a period of two weeks. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Concert synopsis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage, surrounded by several long draped &lt;unk&gt;. Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour, Trey Lorenz, &lt;unk&gt; Daniels and Kelly Price. As the introduction began with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, each of the &lt;unk&gt; were slowly draped, revealing Carey atop the platform, dressed in a beige mini &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dress and matching sheer &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; heels. As she began performing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song &lt;unk&gt;s performance. After an intimate performance with &lt;unk&gt; lights for &lt;unk&gt; The Roof ( Back in Time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Carey was joined on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage by a Peruvian guitar player, who played the Latin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inspired guitar melodies during her performance of &lt;unk&gt; My All &lt;unk&gt;. Afterwards, Carey sang &lt;unk&gt; Close My Eyes &lt;unk&gt;, the only sitting performance of the show. During the song, several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage. For the second part of the show, Carey had the second costume change of the evening, donning a long &lt;unk&gt; black gown and semi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hair. For the performance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Carey was joined by three female back &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up dancers, who mimicked her light dance routines during the song. The next song on the set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; list was &lt;unk&gt; Hero &lt;unk&gt;, which featured Carey alone on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage, without any vocal back &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up.

She &lt;unk&gt; a short mini &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; skirt, alongside a &lt;unk&gt; white &lt;unk&gt; and loose golden &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stage, Carey was joined by a full church choir, all dressed in long black garments. After the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, Carey performed &lt;unk&gt; One Sweet Day &lt;unk&gt;, alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in &lt;unk&gt;. After completing the song, Carey changed to a pair of leg &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hugging blue &lt;unk&gt; and a tank top. Her next performance was the &lt;unk&gt; Fantasy &lt;unk&gt; remix, featuring &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Dirty &lt;unk&gt; on a large projection screen behind the stage, as Carey performed light chair dance &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; routines alongside several male dancers. The performance featured the most intricate choreography Carey performed on the tour. After a low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; key performance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, or &lt;unk&gt; Whenever You Call &lt;unk&gt; in other countries, Carey was once again joined by several male dancers, as she sang &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the music video during a small &lt;unk&gt;. Carey once again changed to a beige ensemble similar to her first outfit before performing her debut single, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ision of Love &lt;unk&gt;.

During the song, Carey &lt;unk&gt; a Santa suit and matching hat, while being carried on a large stage prop by the dancers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the entire tour was an instant sell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out ; the four shows at &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s largest stadium, Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, broke Carey &lt;unk&gt;s previous ticket &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sales record, selling out all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tickets in under one hour. Additionally, the entire Australian leg sold out within hours, leading Carey to extend the tour one more date in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The show at Hawaii &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; capacity &lt;unk&gt; Stadium sold out as well, making her one of the few acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue. Aside from its commercial success, fans and critics &lt;unk&gt; about the show &lt;unk&gt;s visuals, as well as Carey &lt;unk&gt;s vocal delivery. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and recordings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the tour, several bits and performances were filmed and later edited into a &lt;unk&gt;HS and D&lt;unk&gt;D entitled Around the World. The &lt;unk&gt;HS featured performances from Tokyo &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Stadium as well as few other &lt;unk&gt; and scenes that were later compiled into the video. The film first begins with performances in Hawaii, where the song &lt;unk&gt;s recitals are cut into halves, excluding the second verses and bridge to shorten the bulk length of the video. Afterwards, Carey &lt;unk&gt;s performance of &lt;unk&gt; My All &lt;unk&gt; is shown in inter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; cut scenes from &lt;unk&gt;apan and &lt;unk&gt;.

The &lt;unk&gt; is located at &lt;unk&gt;, Suffolk, England. It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; worked by wind power until &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on two sails, after which it became &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a group of enthusiasts purchased &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site. The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt;. It drives two pairs of &lt;unk&gt;, with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; was built by &lt;unk&gt; George &lt;unk&gt; for William Button in &lt;unk&gt;. It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane, &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk the previous year. The mill was set to work on Christmas Day &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt;, Patent sails and a &lt;unk&gt;. The new &lt;unk&gt; was fitted on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. It was made by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Kings Lynn &lt;unk&gt;, and weighs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt;. A new stock was fitted in September &lt;unk&gt;. William Button died on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard. Richard Button worked the mill until &lt;unk&gt;, at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William, who sold it to Richard &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk in &lt;unk&gt;. The mill was worked by Stephen &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt;s son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in &lt;unk&gt; and leased it to Henry Bryant in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the &lt;unk&gt;. Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From &lt;unk&gt;, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of &lt;unk&gt; on the ground floor. This was replaced in &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt; oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until &lt;unk&gt; when he sold it to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;incent, a retired &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, Norfolk. The &lt;unk&gt; engine was sold in the early &lt;unk&gt;s. The mill was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. &lt;unk&gt;incent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in &lt;unk&gt;. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in &lt;unk&gt; when the mill was again &lt;unk&gt;. On the death of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;incent in &lt;unk&gt;, his son George inherited the property. He lived at the site in an old &lt;unk&gt; until his death in &lt;unk&gt;. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in &lt;unk&gt; to Mr and Mrs &lt;unk&gt;, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In &lt;unk&gt;, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November &lt;unk&gt;, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark &lt;unk&gt;, Charles &lt;unk&gt;, Peter &lt;unk&gt;, David &lt;unk&gt; and Chris &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; mill and an acre of land cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Restoration &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The mill was restored over a period of six years. Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The consortium took possession of the mill in November &lt;unk&gt;. The first priority was to make the mill as &lt;unk&gt; as possible. &lt;unk&gt; sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring &lt;unk&gt;, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. &lt;unk&gt; was erected to allow the &lt;unk&gt; to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame. A two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; week work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in was held at the end of &lt;unk&gt;uly and beginning of August &lt;unk&gt;. Thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; three volunteers worked on the mill over the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine which had previously been in a &lt;unk&gt; at Bury St &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron curb sections. New oak &lt;unk&gt; were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was &lt;unk&gt;. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak &lt;unk&gt; were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the &lt;unk&gt; were made from pitch pine from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which, following its collapse on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;, had been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new &lt;unk&gt; were made for some of the windows. A &lt;unk&gt; was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The &lt;unk&gt; on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; was removed. The work was financed by grants of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; Trust, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Suffolk Mills Group. Other donations and income amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners. The &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; was reported in both local and national media, including BBC Look East, Bury Free Press, Eastern Daily Press, East Anglian Daily Times, Daily Telegraph, and Radio Orwell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt; season two separate work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held, the first from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; August and the second from &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. A total of &lt;unk&gt; volunteers participated over the two weeks. The &lt;unk&gt; were removed from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles, and over a third of the &lt;unk&gt; beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the &lt;unk&gt; frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had &lt;unk&gt; and the floor had sunk by &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed. The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was &lt;unk&gt;. The stone floor was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those &lt;unk&gt; that were fit for reuse. Other &lt;unk&gt; were made new from oak or pitch pine. New &lt;unk&gt; were laid in the dust floor, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick &lt;unk&gt; boards being double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a &lt;unk&gt; attached to the upright shaft. During the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the remainder of the stone floor was boarded, again using double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete &lt;unk&gt; cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The &lt;unk&gt;, the curb segments and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were given two coats of red lead paint. A new &lt;unk&gt; for the cap was made from a piece of oak &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; long by &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; mortar. After the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in had finished, the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; received were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the Historic Buildings Council and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins took place from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower, installation of the &lt;unk&gt; curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn &lt;unk&gt;. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the &lt;unk&gt; into position. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Work in the early part of &lt;unk&gt; was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various &lt;unk&gt; and overhaul of the various parts of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails. The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits, including one from the Wind and &lt;unk&gt; Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; stones, including &lt;unk&gt; the stone nut and replacement of three &lt;unk&gt; in beech. When the weather improved, work commenced outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in commenced. The work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins took place over two separate weeks in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August, with &lt;unk&gt; people participating. During the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the &lt;unk&gt; posts and &lt;unk&gt; were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated &lt;unk&gt; were fitted and the &lt;unk&gt; was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of oak were fitted and the &lt;unk&gt; was pulled into position using a &lt;unk&gt;. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and &lt;unk&gt;. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time. Between the two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins, the rear &lt;unk&gt; was completed and the fitting of &lt;unk&gt; to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. The boards for the cap are &lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; wide at the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the &lt;unk&gt;, not without difficulty and much &lt;unk&gt; before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The &lt;unk&gt; was drawn into position using a rope and &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; steel reinforcing band &lt;unk&gt; into position, producing a &lt;unk&gt; structure. The striking rod was fitted through the &lt;unk&gt; and the axle for the &lt;unk&gt; fitted in position on top of the &lt;unk&gt; posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates &lt;unk&gt; into position. &lt;unk&gt; of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. After the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins had ended, work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application of a modern &lt;unk&gt; paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain &lt;unk&gt;, was completed in time for the lift &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on. A mini work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with &lt;unk&gt; people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The &lt;unk&gt; was removed and the &lt;unk&gt; dismantled. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, watched by a crowd of some &lt;unk&gt; people. The fitting of the cap was &lt;unk&gt; with beer from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Restoration work in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Norton Women &lt;unk&gt;s Institute, Ipswich Historical Transport Society, the National Association for &lt;unk&gt; Children, Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Four work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held during &lt;unk&gt;. The first two were by &lt;unk&gt; from Eastern Electricity Board. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person &lt;unk&gt;s Development Project for that year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A &lt;unk&gt; electricity supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were &lt;unk&gt; a thrust &lt;unk&gt; which had been developed at their research facility at &lt;unk&gt; Heath. The thrust &lt;unk&gt; laid &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; through which the &lt;unk&gt; cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and &lt;unk&gt; on each floor. Other work undertaken by the &lt;unk&gt; involved repairing some &lt;unk&gt; damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising &lt;unk&gt;. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A &lt;unk&gt; horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; diesel engine had been purchased in &lt;unk&gt; and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; site, the new brake wheel and &lt;unk&gt; were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in &lt;unk&gt;. The original brake wheel was &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their &lt;unk&gt; speed. When the mill was modernised in &lt;unk&gt; it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original &lt;unk&gt;, resulting in a wheel &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in diameter. The opinion of professional &lt;unk&gt; was sought, and it was decided that a scaled &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; was made. Some of the small &lt;unk&gt; were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the &lt;unk&gt; from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in began. New beech &lt;unk&gt; were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins held in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August, a total of &lt;unk&gt; people attending over the two weeks. A second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand stock had been bought in the &lt;unk&gt;s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and &lt;unk&gt; grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or &lt;unk&gt; stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not &lt;unk&gt; in the lengths required. Douglas fir was &lt;unk&gt; in such lengths but was discounted on strength and &lt;unk&gt; grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had &lt;unk&gt; after only seven years. Thus it was decided that &lt;unk&gt; stocks would be made. The &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with &lt;unk&gt; and well &lt;unk&gt;. It was estimated that a &lt;unk&gt; stock would be up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and nine &lt;unk&gt; were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first &lt;unk&gt; stocks made by amateurs. The four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long &lt;unk&gt; were cut from a &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine obtained from a demolished &lt;unk&gt; at Bury St &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; are &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; square at their inner end. &lt;unk&gt; bars and &lt;unk&gt; were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The &lt;unk&gt; for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and that at the tip being &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, decreasing by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in. The &lt;unk&gt; and associated &lt;unk&gt; was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; itself, with the &lt;unk&gt; painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The &lt;unk&gt; arm brake wheel was assembled around the &lt;unk&gt;. It was found that the &lt;unk&gt; was eccentric on the upright shaft by &lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. When this was corrected the brake wheel was within &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of an inch ( less than &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of true. The &lt;unk&gt; for the stocks were &lt;unk&gt; from a &lt;unk&gt; of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting &lt;unk&gt; and further &lt;unk&gt; on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the &lt;unk&gt; and when &lt;unk&gt; in position and the &lt;unk&gt; had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in. Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the &lt;unk&gt; and sorting out &lt;unk&gt; troubles with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the sails were cast. Restoration work in &lt;unk&gt; cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Grants received were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from English Heritage, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from St &lt;unk&gt; Borough Council, Other donations amounted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; from open days at the mill came to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A boost to the funds was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a &lt;unk&gt; post mill buck to &lt;unk&gt;. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr &lt;unk&gt; allowed the donation to remain with the &lt;unk&gt; Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the East Anglian Daily Times, one of the work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins being featured on &lt;unk&gt; Television &lt;unk&gt;s About &lt;unk&gt; programme. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; - &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Work planned for &lt;unk&gt; included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were &lt;unk&gt; and internal walls plastered. Two work &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins were held, from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and &lt;unk&gt; August to &lt;unk&gt; August. Further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Restoration team &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The restoration of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was made possible by the efforts of &lt;unk&gt; individuals and &lt;unk&gt; organisations. This was achieved by the donation of labour, plant, materials or grants of money, or by giving &lt;unk&gt; for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Terms explained in the Mill machinery article are in italics As built in &lt;unk&gt; A four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden &lt;unk&gt;, driving two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; wheel &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter. &lt;unk&gt; was by hand. As restored The four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; storey tower is built of brick, and stands &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; from ground level to the curb. The walls are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick at ground level. The mill is described from the top down. The &lt;unk&gt; cap sits on top of the tower, giving the mill an overall height of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;. It houses the cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter wooden brake wheel internally. &lt;unk&gt; the four double Patent sails span &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. They are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide and can develop &lt;unk&gt; horsepower ( &lt;unk&gt; kW &lt;unk&gt;. The eight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; keeps the mill turned into wind. The top floor of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives internal access to the cap. The cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; iron &lt;unk&gt;, which is driven by the brake wheel is carried at the top of the upright shaft, in the centre of the mill. The bin floor is where the grain is stored before being ground into flour. The &lt;unk&gt; hoist mechanism is housed on this floor, driven from the wooden crown wheel on the floor below by belt. The stone floor is where the two pairs of &lt;unk&gt; French Burr &lt;unk&gt; are located. The stones are &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the &lt;unk&gt; hoist on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and a flour &lt;unk&gt;. The ground floor of the mill is the meal floor. It is where the &lt;unk&gt; ground flour is delivered for &lt;unk&gt; up. The wooden great spur wheel, located at the bottom of the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor. The great spur wheel has been converted from &lt;unk&gt; arm construction to &lt;unk&gt; arm construction. A third pair of &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; diameter French Burr &lt;unk&gt; is located on a &lt;unk&gt; frame, driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; William Button &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rebecca Button &lt;unk&gt;??

It is also open at other times by prior arrangement. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; is the first segment of the &lt;unk&gt;th episode of the second season, or the &lt;unk&gt;th overall episode of the American animated television series &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The episode was directed by Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, and was written by Walt &lt;unk&gt;, Paul &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Williams. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also served as storyboard directors, and Carson &lt;unk&gt;, William &lt;unk&gt;, and Erik &lt;unk&gt; worked as storyboard artists. It originally aired on &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The series follows the adventures and &lt;unk&gt; of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In this episode, &lt;unk&gt; reads a &lt;unk&gt; bad word &lt;unk&gt; off a &lt;unk&gt; behind the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but does not know what it means. Patrick explains to him that it is a &lt;unk&gt; sentence &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which is used &lt;unk&gt; when you want to talk fancy. &lt;unk&gt; The two start using it in every sentence they speak. However, when Mr. &lt;unk&gt; hears them, he warns the two never to use the word again or any of the &lt;unk&gt; bad words. Later on, &lt;unk&gt; accidentally swears again. Patrick then runs to tell Mr. &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; trying to stop him. However, when Mr. &lt;unk&gt; accidentally &lt;unk&gt; his toe, he &lt;unk&gt; all the &lt;unk&gt; bad words. The two cannot believe it and run to Mama &lt;unk&gt; to tell on him. Mama &lt;unk&gt;, who is &lt;unk&gt; by their use of the words, makes the three paint her house as punishment. The episode received positive reviews, while various members of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; crew consider the episode to be one of their favorites, mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode. However, the episode was not immune to negative reception, and was criticized by &lt;unk&gt; media group the Parents Television Council and fans, who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly &lt;unk&gt; use of &lt;unk&gt; towards children. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot summary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When &lt;unk&gt; goes around to the back of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to take out the trash, he reads some words written on a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; asks Patrick what is it and Patrick says that the word is a &lt;unk&gt; sentence &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which is used &lt;unk&gt; when you want to talk fancy. &lt;unk&gt; The next day, &lt;unk&gt; walks into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and says the word to Patrick and then over the &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; customers are &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s use of his &lt;unk&gt; word &lt;unk&gt; and leave. &lt;unk&gt; then informs Mr. &lt;unk&gt;, who then decides to tell them that they were using &lt;unk&gt;, and mentions that there are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; words they should not use. &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick vow Mr. &lt;unk&gt; that they will never use &lt;unk&gt; words again. Later, they play their favorite game, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Patrick always gets &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; always gets &lt;unk&gt;. Eventually, he loses the game and accidentally &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; word. Patrick then races to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to tell Mr. &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; trying to stop him. &lt;unk&gt; bursts through the front door and tells Mr. &lt;unk&gt; that Patrick said the &lt;unk&gt; word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. &lt;unk&gt; stops their &lt;unk&gt; explanations, and takes &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick outside and makes them paint the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as punishment. Mr. &lt;unk&gt; is about to give &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick the job, but he hits his foot on a rock, throws the paint away and says all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; words while complaining about his foot being injured. When &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick hear all the &lt;unk&gt; words, they run to Mama &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; house to tell her that Mr. &lt;unk&gt; swears. When they all reach her house, they repeat the same &lt;unk&gt; words that Mr. &lt;unk&gt; used. This makes her faint, but shortly after Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick for saying all those bad words in front of her she &lt;unk&gt; consciousness. Mama &lt;unk&gt; states that all three of them should be &lt;unk&gt; for saying all those words. She then gives all three of them the task of painting her house with a fresh coat of paint as punishment for saying those words at her. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was directed by Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, and was written by Walt &lt;unk&gt;, Paul &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Williams. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also served as storyboard directors, and Carson &lt;unk&gt;, William &lt;unk&gt; and Erik &lt;unk&gt; worked as storyboard artists. Series creator Stephen &lt;unk&gt; has described the episode plot as &lt;unk&gt; a classic thing all kids go through. &lt;unk&gt; Much of the storyline for the episode was inspired by the writers &lt;unk&gt; own experiences from childhood. The episode originally aired on &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The episode marks the introduction of Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mother, Mama &lt;unk&gt;, who was voiced by former &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; creative producer and current executive producer Paul &lt;unk&gt;. The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode. The idea for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was inspired by creative director Derek &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s experience &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when &lt;unk&gt; I got in trouble for saying the f &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; word in front of my mother. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life. &lt;unk&gt; The end of the episode, where Mr. &lt;unk&gt; uses more &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick, was also inspired &lt;unk&gt; by the fact that my &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; mother has a sailor mouth herself. &lt;unk&gt; The scene where &lt;unk&gt; and Patrick playing a game of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, which is a parody of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, was difficult for the crew to &lt;unk&gt;, since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location. According to the series &lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; D&lt;unk&gt;D commentary, it was planned to have a scene that had &lt;unk&gt; saying &lt;unk&gt; Go &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; noise &lt;unk&gt; yourself &lt;unk&gt; followed by Patrick saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; noise &lt;unk&gt; you too! &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; game. It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was released on the D&lt;unk&gt;D compilation called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : Sea Stories on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It was also included in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The Complete &lt;unk&gt;nd Season D&lt;unk&gt;D released on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. On September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was released on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The First &lt;unk&gt; Episodes, alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Erik &lt;unk&gt;, a member of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; crew, considers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; to be his favorite episode, mainly due to its random and satirical nature, saying &lt;unk&gt; Sometimes &lt;unk&gt; just catches me off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guard. &lt;unk&gt; Nancy &lt;unk&gt; of About.com ranked the episode at number two for her list of the Top &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Episodes. She said &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; just barely missed being in the number one slot. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; praised the episode &lt;unk&gt;s plot and called it &lt;unk&gt; genius &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; because children can relate to the forbidden &lt;unk&gt; of using curse words, and adults can laugh at the parody of T&lt;unk&gt; censorship. &lt;unk&gt; In an interview with Paul &lt;unk&gt;, one of the episode &lt;unk&gt;s writers, he told that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; is his second favorite &lt;unk&gt; episode. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Criticism and controversy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to a report titled Wolves in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, which documents the increase in potentially violent, &lt;unk&gt;, and sexual content in children &lt;unk&gt;s programming, the Parents Television Council, a &lt;unk&gt; media group, and fans believed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; episode &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; was an implicit attempt to promote and &lt;unk&gt; use of &lt;unk&gt; among children. The episode originally aired during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; television season, ironically the season in which the PTC named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; among the best programs on cable television, but the report cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from &lt;unk&gt; to prove its point that it promoted use of &lt;unk&gt; among children. In a later report, several members of the PTC listed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt; as an example of how levels of &lt;unk&gt;, sexual, and violent activity has increased in children &lt;unk&gt;s television programming. &lt;unk&gt;, in response to the incident, said &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s sad and a little desperate that they &lt;unk&gt; to literally putting &lt;unk&gt; language in the mouths of our characters to make a point. Has the FCC looked at this? &lt;unk&gt; Richard &lt;unk&gt; of the New York Daily News criticized the report for &lt;unk&gt; an episode of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mouth &lt;unk&gt;, over its intent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; implicitly.  &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is a blues song by American folk and blues musician, Lead &lt;unk&gt;. It was written in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead &lt;unk&gt; faced during a visit to Washington, DC to record for Alan &lt;unk&gt;. It rails against racism, the &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws, and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The song was recorded in December &lt;unk&gt; for the Library of Congress and re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded in &lt;unk&gt; for commercial release. It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Hans &lt;unk&gt;, and Billy Bragg. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is regarded as one of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s best original works, but it also drew controversy. There is doubt over the song &lt;unk&gt;s authorship, with some scholars &lt;unk&gt; that Lead &lt;unk&gt; was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator. &lt;unk&gt; have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party &lt;unk&gt;s political goals. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and creation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Most music historians date the writing of &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; to Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited by the &lt;unk&gt; Alan &lt;unk&gt; to record for the Library of Congress &lt;unk&gt;s folk music collection. On the first night Lead &lt;unk&gt; and his wife Martha spent in the city, they encountered racially &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, in some versions of the story described as an unnamed &lt;unk&gt; white friend &lt;unk&gt;, offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building. The next morning, Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; arguing with his &lt;unk&gt; about the presence of a black man, with the &lt;unk&gt; threatening to call the police. While in Washington, Lead &lt;unk&gt; encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the &lt;unk&gt; of the song. For instance, when Lead &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead &lt;unk&gt; was told that if he returned later without &lt;unk&gt;, he would be served. In response to one of these incidents, a friend of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, variously identified as either &lt;unk&gt; or Mary Elizabeth &lt;unk&gt; joked that Washington was a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; town. &lt;unk&gt; Though Lead &lt;unk&gt; did not know what the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meant, he was fascinated by the sound of it, and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip. The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead &lt;unk&gt; to write it. &lt;unk&gt; liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lyrics, themes and music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is a blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington, DC. It protests against both the city &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;im Crow laws and the racism of its white population. Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to &lt;unk&gt; spread the news all around &lt;unk&gt; about the racial issues &lt;unk&gt; the city. The song, particularly in the refrain, &lt;unk&gt; race and economics by referring to &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead &lt;unk&gt; encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip, Lead &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; turned down &lt;unk&gt; wherever he tried to get served due to his race, while the second recounts the argument between &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt; over Lead &lt;unk&gt; staying in his apartment. The third verse &lt;unk&gt; cites &lt;unk&gt; the home of the brave, the land of the Free &lt;unk&gt;, juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington, DC. The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city, leading to the song &lt;unk&gt;s end, which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district. The song &lt;unk&gt;s tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this, by &lt;unk&gt; spreading the news &lt;unk&gt; of his poor treatment in a song, the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status &lt;unk&gt; is deeply flawed and that something needs to change. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; follows a traditional twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bar blues format. It is written in &lt;unk&gt; time but &lt;unk&gt; to note that the song &lt;unk&gt; should swing at medium &lt;unk&gt;. The song was written in B &lt;unk&gt;. It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating, followed by the final two verses and a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Recordings and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lead &lt;unk&gt; first recorded &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt; in New York City, for donation to the Library of Congress. He re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded the song in April &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; Records, for release the same year as a &lt;unk&gt; rpm record. The version that was commercially released features Lead &lt;unk&gt; singing and playing the twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; string guitar without any other accompaniment. The song has been covered and &lt;unk&gt; by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans &lt;unk&gt;. Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums. In Australia, the song was reworked as &lt;unk&gt; Canberra Blues &lt;unk&gt; by The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an R &lt;unk&gt; B band. The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt; adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album &lt;unk&gt;ourney On in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Billy Bragg reworked the song as &lt;unk&gt; Bush War Blues &lt;unk&gt;. Bragg &lt;unk&gt;s cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War. In one verse, Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to &lt;unk&gt; make the world safe for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In another, he takes on the Christian right, asking where the &lt;unk&gt; are. Finally, Bragg &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;nited States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Blues &lt;unk&gt; is one of Lead &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most famous songs and is remembered as his most &lt;unk&gt; heartfelt protest song &lt;unk&gt;. There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance. Robert &lt;unk&gt; claims that the song is &lt;unk&gt; peripheral &lt;unk&gt; to the wider study of the blues, while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wing political groups. Lead &lt;unk&gt; was invited to perform at Camp &lt;unk&gt;nity, the Communist Party &lt;unk&gt;SA &lt;unk&gt;s summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the &lt;unk&gt;s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. &lt;unk&gt;eff Todd &lt;unk&gt; and several other writers have suggested that Lead &lt;unk&gt; had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song. This theory stems from the idea that Lead &lt;unk&gt; did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by &lt;unk&gt;. Since the music that &lt;unk&gt; recorded was sold to &lt;unk&gt; sympathetic to Civil Rights, it has been suggested that &lt;unk&gt; helped him write a song attractive to a white audience. Lead &lt;unk&gt; admitted that the term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was unfamiliar to him, and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Madonna song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It was written and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price, and released as the second single from the album on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It later appeared on Celebration, her &lt;unk&gt; greatest hits album. An uptempo dance song, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was one of the first tracks developed for the album and had numerous remix treatments before the ultimate version of the track was finalized. One of the remixes was done by the Pet Shop Boys, featuring added lyrics by the band. The actual song features a dance groove tempo. It talks about personal &lt;unk&gt; and self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;. Some critics also commented on the song &lt;unk&gt;s disco &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; influenced beats while comparing it to Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s older dance songs. It achieved commercial success, topping the singles charts in Italy, Spain, Romania and the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, where it became Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s twelfth number one single. Elsewhere, the song was a top ten hit. However, in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, the song did not perform well due to an &lt;unk&gt; on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard &lt;unk&gt;s dance charts and became one of the decade &lt;unk&gt;s most successful dance hits. The accompanying music video, directed by Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;amie King, was a continuation from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; music video. It featured Madonna and her dancers &lt;unk&gt; around a city in a van, dancing on roller &lt;unk&gt; and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage. She performed the song on her &lt;unk&gt; Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video. An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song, which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;, along with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Future Lovers &lt;unk&gt;. It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna &lt;unk&gt; thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right. &lt;unk&gt; The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind. Madonna commented that, &lt;unk&gt; Whenever I make records, I often like the remixes better than the original ones. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; So I thought, screw that. I &lt;unk&gt;m going to start from that perspective &lt;unk&gt;. She promoted the album at the dance party &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; held at Luke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s nightclub in Greenwich &lt;unk&gt;illage, invited by &lt;unk&gt;unior &lt;unk&gt; to take over the D&lt;unk&gt; booth where she mixed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Musically, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus. It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. &lt;unk&gt; in the key of C minor, Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s vocal range spans from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. It follows the chord progression of E &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; during the spoken introduction. It then changes to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the chorus, while continuing in A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve heard it all before &lt;unk&gt;. Lyrically the song has &lt;unk&gt; of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The song talks about personal &lt;unk&gt; and self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like &lt;unk&gt; Everybody &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ogue &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song &lt;unk&gt; Heart &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album &lt;unk&gt; Four. Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical response &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ennifer &lt;unk&gt; of MT&lt;unk&gt; News wrote that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the &lt;unk&gt; album &lt;unk&gt;s strongest track &lt;unk&gt; and that it is a &lt;unk&gt; Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; esque &lt;unk&gt; song. &lt;unk&gt; went on to say that it &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; evokes the sounds of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; era dance clubs that first &lt;unk&gt; her toward stardom. &lt;unk&gt; According to a review in the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; New single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; states &lt;unk&gt;ueen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; stance, and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics : &lt;unk&gt; there are more important things than hearing you speak &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Alan &lt;unk&gt; from BBC Music called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; catchy &lt;unk&gt;. Mike &lt;unk&gt; of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The &lt;unk&gt;acksons &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; Can You Feel It &lt;unk&gt;. The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of &lt;unk&gt;. In a review of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;irgin Media, it wrote that the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; features an &lt;unk&gt; infectious &lt;unk&gt; of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats &lt;unk&gt;. Keith &lt;unk&gt; from Billboard commented that, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; should keep fans hung up on Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s ability to create instant radio and club classics. &lt;unk&gt; He also called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while reviewing the album. Ben Williams of New York magazine, wrote that the song is &lt;unk&gt; propelled by a catchy bass melody &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;oan Morgan of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice, in review of Confessions on a Dance &lt;unk&gt;, wrote : &lt;unk&gt; The party continues &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt;, kick &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; curb &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Stephen M. &lt;unk&gt; of Pitchfork Media wrote, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of sound wash directly into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, setting up the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and shifting bass &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;on Pareles of The New York Times wrote that the first half of the album consists of love songs, happy and sad, and included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; into the mix. Alexis &lt;unk&gt; from The Guardian called the song as triumphant. Kitty Empire from the same newspaper said that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sees Madonna taking a lover to task over an &lt;unk&gt; dance &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pop rush. &lt;unk&gt; Alan Light from Rolling Stone called the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Thomas &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; magazine commented that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and first single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; may not be as &lt;unk&gt; like Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s initial singles &lt;unk&gt; Burning &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; Physical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but they have the same &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of being designed for all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; night dancing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chart performance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; debuted at number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt; chart for the issue dated March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and reached a peak of &lt;unk&gt; the following week. The same week it reached a peak of &lt;unk&gt; on the Pop &lt;unk&gt; chart. Its low chart performance in America was attributed to limited radio airplay. A petition was signed by about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fans at &lt;unk&gt; Known as the &lt;unk&gt; End the Madonna &lt;unk&gt;.S. Radio &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; it was addressed to &lt;unk&gt; Channel Communications CEO Mark P. Mays. Message boards at Entertainment Weekly and &lt;unk&gt;H&lt;unk&gt; were filled with entries by users showing support for Madonna, as well as conspiracy theories about why she was not played on radio. The song, however, reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart for two weeks, as well as Hot Dance Airplay chart for five weeks. As of April &lt;unk&gt;, the song has sold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; digital units in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. In the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, it debuted at number one on the chart dated February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The song became Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th number one single in Britain and second consecutive single from the album to peak the British chart, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p. &lt;unk&gt; This made Madonna the female artist with most number one songs in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, while placing her in fifth place in overall &lt;unk&gt;. According to the Official Charts Company, the song has sold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; digital downloads there and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI &lt;unk&gt;.

It was directed by Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s longtime &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;amie King and featured choreography from The &lt;unk&gt; Brothers. Many of the performers featured in Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video were in that of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was shot as a continuation from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video. Madonna &lt;unk&gt;s parts in the video were shot first, followed by the shot of the &lt;unk&gt;. The shoot took place for over two days. The video starts with Madonna standing in front of neon &lt;unk&gt; screen in a purple &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in different languages. As the music starts she comes out from the gaming &lt;unk&gt; of her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;p &lt;unk&gt; video with her dancers. They board a van where Madonna and her dancers strip of their clothes into new ones. Madonna wears a white &lt;unk&gt; with a matching &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with her hair in &lt;unk&gt;s retro inspired style and pair of knee high silver platform boots. As they move around the city in the van, they pick up different men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse &lt;unk&gt; Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts &lt;unk&gt; backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller &lt;unk&gt;. The video ends with the close &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up of Madonna in the purple &lt;unk&gt; and fades into her &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was performed on the &lt;unk&gt; Confessions Tour as part of the &lt;unk&gt; themed segment. Madonna was dressed in a &lt;unk&gt;ean &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Paul &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with pants and high &lt;unk&gt; boots. As Madonna finished the performance of the song &lt;unk&gt; Isaac &lt;unk&gt;, she took off the &lt;unk&gt; and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and &lt;unk&gt; them one by one. The Pet Shop Boys music for the song &lt;unk&gt;s remix start in the background. Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song. As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her &lt;unk&gt; her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer &lt;unk&gt;s back. The song was also used as a video backdrop during the interlude between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rock sections. The video featured images of fascists and political leaders from past and present like Adolf Hitler and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to George W. Bush and Tony Blair. Their images &lt;unk&gt; across the screen, with text and footage of war atrocities &lt;unk&gt; in between. Madonna appears on the screens wearing her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; video &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the words &lt;unk&gt; talk is cheap &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; don &lt;unk&gt;t speak &lt;unk&gt;, along with the music and Bush &lt;unk&gt;s lips &lt;unk&gt;. The performances of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the remix video was included in The Confessions Tour CD and D&lt;unk&gt;D. The Daily Mail called the performance &lt;unk&gt; energetic &lt;unk&gt;. Tom Young from BBC Music called the performance a &lt;unk&gt; delight &lt;unk&gt; but described the video as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the tour. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine wrote that the performance was not among the concert &lt;unk&gt;s highlights. However, he commented that the remix backdrop &lt;unk&gt; feels &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; weight you can dance too &lt;unk&gt;. Thomas &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; described the song &lt;unk&gt;s performance and remix as &lt;unk&gt; fantastic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Track listings and formats &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Credits and personnel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Madonna &lt;unk&gt; Lead vocals, producer Stuart Price &lt;unk&gt; Producer Neil Tennant &lt;unk&gt; Supporting vocals Guy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Management &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mixing Giovanni Bianco &lt;unk&gt; Graphic Design, Art Direction Orlando &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, A &lt;unk&gt; R Angela Becker &lt;unk&gt; Management Ian Green &lt;unk&gt; Programming, Producer Paul &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pete &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Programming Steven Klein &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Producer, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Charts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Certifications &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleship Asahi &lt;unk&gt; Asahi ( &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi &lt;unk&gt; was a pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Navy ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the late &lt;unk&gt;s. As &lt;unk&gt;apan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself, the ship was designed and built in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. Shortly after her arrival in &lt;unk&gt;apan, she became flagship of the Standing Fleet, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s primary combat fleet. She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi saw no combat during World War I, although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; as a coastal defence ship in &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship. She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was recommissioned in late &lt;unk&gt;, after the start of the Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War, and used to transport &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops. In &lt;unk&gt;, she was converted into a repair ship and based first at &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; occupied Shanghai, China, and then Cam &lt;unk&gt; Bay, French Indochina, from late &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early &lt;unk&gt; to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May. She was sunk en route by the American submarine &lt;unk&gt;SS Salmon, although most of her crew survived. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Combat experience in the First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; convinced the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Navy of weaknesses in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;cole naval philosophy, which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships. Therefore, &lt;unk&gt;apan promulgated a ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year naval build &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up in early &lt;unk&gt;, to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations, with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core. These ships were paid for from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; indemnity paid by China after losing the First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War. As with the earlier Fuji and &lt;unk&gt; classes, &lt;unk&gt;apan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and turned again to the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme. Asahi, the fifth &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleship to be built in Britain, was ordered from the &lt;unk&gt; Engineering &lt;unk&gt; Shipbuilding Company shipyard in &lt;unk&gt;, Scotland in the &lt;unk&gt; annual naval programme. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design and description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s design was a modified version of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class battleships of the Royal Navy, with two additional &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; guns.

Asahi had a complete double bottom with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compartments. Her hull was also subdivided into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compartments. She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about &lt;unk&gt; officers and enlisted men, including the admiral &lt;unk&gt;s staff. The ship was powered by two vertical triple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; expansion steam engines built by &lt;unk&gt;, Tennant, each driving one propeller, using steam generated by &lt;unk&gt; Belleville boilers at a working pressure of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bar ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

They were mounted in twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The &lt;unk&gt; powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse, at a fixed elevation of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

The barbettes were &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick, but only &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; behind the upper armour &lt;unk&gt;. The barbette &lt;unk&gt; were protected by &lt;unk&gt; inches of armour on their face while their sides were &lt;unk&gt; inches thick and the roof was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick. &lt;unk&gt; bulkheads connecting the barbettes to the side armour were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches thick, but only &lt;unk&gt; inches thick at the lower deck level. The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also &lt;unk&gt; inches thick with the rear protected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; armour plates. The flat portion of the deck armour was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick and &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship. The conning tower was protected by &lt;unk&gt; inches of armour. Asahi, like all the other &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships of the time, was fitted with four &lt;unk&gt; and Stroud &lt;unk&gt; coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. The ships were also fitted with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; power &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Construction and career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asahi, meaning &lt;unk&gt; rising sun &lt;unk&gt;, a poetic name for &lt;unk&gt;apan from a stanza of &lt;unk&gt; poetry, was laid down on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Scotland, by the &lt;unk&gt; Engineering &lt;unk&gt; Shipbuilding Co. and completed by &lt;unk&gt;ohn Brown &lt;unk&gt; Company, which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed. She was launched on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; and completed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off &lt;unk&gt; following sea trials. The ship departed England, after repairs in Portsmouth, on the day of her completion, and arrived at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;apan, on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; and was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Battleship Division of the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; formed on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. At the start of the Russo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War, Asahi, commanded by Captain &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Division of the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet. She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;, when &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; led the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser &lt;unk&gt;, which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences. &lt;unk&gt; chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. &lt;unk&gt; his fire proved to be a poor decision as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; and six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships with some effect. Although many ships on both sides were hit, Russian casualties numbered only &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt;apanese suffered &lt;unk&gt; killed and wounded before &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was not hit during the engagement. The ship participated in the action of &lt;unk&gt; April, when &lt;unk&gt; successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s flagship, the battleship &lt;unk&gt;. When &lt;unk&gt; spotted the five battleships of the &lt;unk&gt;st Division, he turned back for Port Arthur and &lt;unk&gt; struck a minefield laid by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese the previous night. The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and &lt;unk&gt; was one of the &lt;unk&gt; killed. &lt;unk&gt; by his success, &lt;unk&gt; resumed long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships the following month. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on &lt;unk&gt; August, Asahi, now commanded by Captain &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was second in line of the column of &lt;unk&gt;apanese battleships, behind &lt;unk&gt;, and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; although both ships were only lightly damaged by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shells struck the bridge of &lt;unk&gt;, killing the Russian squadron commander, &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, two of his staff officers and the ship &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The ship &lt;unk&gt;s wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel &lt;unk&gt;, eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; more than two months later, on &lt;unk&gt; October, Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty. &lt;unk&gt; damaged, she was under repair at &lt;unk&gt; Naval Arsenal from November &lt;unk&gt; to April &lt;unk&gt;. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or &lt;unk&gt; by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi again followed the battleship &lt;unk&gt; into combat, this time against the Second and Third Pacific Squadrons. &lt;unk&gt; opened fire at the battleship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Russian flagship, at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, and was joined by Asahi and the armoured cruiser &lt;unk&gt; shortly afterwards. Within an hour the &lt;unk&gt;apanese ships had started a serious fire aboard the Russian ship, badly wounded the fleet commander, &lt;unk&gt;ice Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, knocked out her rear &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch gun turret, and jammed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s steering so that she fell out of formation. The Russian ships were concentrating their fire on &lt;unk&gt; during the early part of the battle and Asahi was not damaged during this time. &lt;unk&gt; was able to cross the T of the Russian squadrons. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s steering was later repaired, but she &lt;unk&gt; between the &lt;unk&gt;apanese and Russian fleets several times later in the battle and was heavily damaged. Asahi seems to have mostly engaged the battleships &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in the late stages of the battle, although Fuji fired the shots that caused the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s magazines to explode and sink her. Asahi fired more twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch shells, &lt;unk&gt;, than any other ship during the battle. In total, the ship was hit six times during the battle, but none of them damaged her significantly. While Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s casualties are not precisely known, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese only lost &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded to all causes during the battle. The battle was a total &lt;unk&gt;apanese victory with five Russian battleships captured and incorporated into the &lt;unk&gt;. Captain W. C. &lt;unk&gt;, the Royal Navy &lt;unk&gt;s official military observer under the Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese Alliance, took notes of the battle &lt;unk&gt;s progress from a deck chair on Asahi &lt;unk&gt;s exposed quarterdeck. His report confirmed the superiority of &lt;unk&gt;apanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was part of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese fleet that escorted the American Great White Fleet through &lt;unk&gt;apanese waters during its round &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; globe voyage. The ship was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;st Fleet in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi became a gunnery training ship in &lt;unk&gt;, and was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed in &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt;apanese guns replacing her original British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made guns. The same year, she was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;th Division of the &lt;unk&gt;rd Fleet. In &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the &lt;unk&gt;apanese intervention in the Russian Civil War. She escorted troop convoys to the Russian Far East and was guard ship at &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;anuary to August &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was reclassified as a first &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class coastal defence ship on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, and began &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; and her &lt;unk&gt; was completed in &lt;unk&gt;uly of that same year. Her displacement dropped to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; long tons ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; with the loss of her armour and guns, and her speed was limited to &lt;unk&gt; knots ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h ; &lt;unk&gt; mph &lt;unk&gt;. The navy decided to convert Asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August &lt;unk&gt;. From &lt;unk&gt; to October &lt;unk&gt;, the ship &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Belleville boilers were replaced with four &lt;unk&gt; Type &lt;unk&gt; boilers at &lt;unk&gt; Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( ex &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In May &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was fitted with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; compressed &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an &lt;unk&gt; Type &lt;unk&gt; seaplane. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder. On the completion of testing in &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was placed in reserve. &lt;unk&gt; as a repair ship on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was taken out of reserve in November, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese War, and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay. Afterwards she began conversion at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;apan, into a repair ship ; this was completed on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. Asahi was fitted with a &lt;unk&gt; wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on &lt;unk&gt; December. In May &lt;unk&gt; she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between &lt;unk&gt; May and &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. She was transferred to &lt;unk&gt; Bay, French Indochina, on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; and later transported the &lt;unk&gt;th Base &lt;unk&gt;nit from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; Bay &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. From &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was stationed at Singapore, and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser &lt;unk&gt;, which had been torpedoed by the submarine &lt;unk&gt;SS &lt;unk&gt; off Christmas Island. &lt;unk&gt; Singapore for &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May, escorted by the &lt;unk&gt; CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Asahi was sighted by the submarine &lt;unk&gt;SS Salmon on the night of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Cape &lt;unk&gt;, Indochina. Of Salmon &lt;unk&gt;s four torpedoes, two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, moments after being hit, Asahi sank at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; N &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E. Sixteen men were killed in the attack ; the ship &lt;unk&gt;s captain and &lt;unk&gt; crewmen were rescued by CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Frank &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air &lt;unk&gt;ice Marshal Frank &lt;unk&gt;, CB, CBE ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF &lt;unk&gt;. Born and educated in Tasmania, he joined the RAAF as an air cadet in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. He specialised in flying instruction and navigation before the outbreak of World War II. In April &lt;unk&gt;, he became commanding officer of No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron, which operated Lockheed &lt;unk&gt;. The squadron was deployed to Dutch Timor in December, and saw action against &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces in the South West Pacific. After returning to Australia in February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; held staff appointments and training commands, finishing the war a group captain. &lt;unk&gt; served as Officer Commanding North &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Western Area in &lt;unk&gt;, and as Director of Training from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, during the Malayan Emergency, he was stationed at Singapore as commander of No. &lt;unk&gt; ( Composite &lt;unk&gt; Wing and, later, RAF &lt;unk&gt;. He twice served as acting Air Member for Personnel, in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in &lt;unk&gt;. Promoted air vice marshal, he successively held the positions of Air Officer Commanding ( AOC &lt;unk&gt; Operational Command in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, AOC No. &lt;unk&gt; Group RAF from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; during the Indonesia &lt;unk&gt; Malaysia &lt;unk&gt;, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and AOC Support Command in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in &lt;unk&gt;. Following a posting to London as Head of the Australian &lt;unk&gt;oint Services Staff from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, he retired from the Air Force and died in Melbourne five years later. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The son of farmers Malcolm and Hilda &lt;unk&gt;, Frank &lt;unk&gt; was born on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Tasmania. He was &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; College, Hobart, and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF &lt;unk&gt; as an air cadet on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. He underwent flying instruction with No. &lt;unk&gt; Flying Training School ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at RAAF Point Cook, &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, and was commissioned as a pilot officer on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. After completing a conversion course, &lt;unk&gt; was assigned to the &lt;unk&gt; Squadron at Point Cook. No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war RAAF, &lt;unk&gt; Squadron was part of No. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and operated &lt;unk&gt; Southampton flying boats and de Havilland &lt;unk&gt; Moth &lt;unk&gt;, among other types. During this posting &lt;unk&gt; was promoted to flying officer, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with &lt;unk&gt; strong air forces, naval forces ( including submarines &lt;unk&gt;, and fixed defences, Australia may be made practically &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, this paper &lt;unk&gt; in effect, defined the &lt;unk&gt; anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; completed a flying instructors course in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; and joined the staff of No. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s first Long &lt;unk&gt; Navigation Course, run by Flight &lt;unk&gt; Bill &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Murdoch at Point Cook. The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention, including a twelve &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; kilometre ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; round &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Australia trip by three Avro Ansons, one of which was &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;, in November. The following month, &lt;unk&gt; led the three Ansons on a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day journey back and forth over Central Australia. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton, &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, as a flight commander. He served initially with No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron, before transferring to No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron on &lt;unk&gt; August. Both units operated Ansons. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; World War II &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the outbreak of World War II, No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eastern Australia. &lt;unk&gt; continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer. On &lt;unk&gt; March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. He was promoted to squadron leader on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul &lt;unk&gt;s Anglican Church in &lt;unk&gt; ; the couple would have a son and a daughter. &lt;unk&gt; was given command of No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron at Laverton on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt;, and raised to wing commander on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly. &lt;unk&gt; with Lockheed &lt;unk&gt;, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until &lt;unk&gt; December, when four of its aircraft were ordered to Darwin, Northern Territory, in response to fears of &lt;unk&gt;apanese aggression in the Pacific. On &lt;unk&gt; December, this detachment established itself at &lt;unk&gt;, near &lt;unk&gt; in Dutch Timor, while No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron &lt;unk&gt;s eight remaining &lt;unk&gt; were stationed at Darwin on standby. The following day, aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific, one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based &lt;unk&gt; attacked the &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was suspected of being a radio ship, and forced it aground. By &lt;unk&gt; December, &lt;unk&gt; had transferred to &lt;unk&gt; as commanding officer of the base, as well as No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron. During &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron &lt;unk&gt;s aircraft were dispersed at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Island, and Darwin. The &lt;unk&gt; detachment attacked &lt;unk&gt;apanese shipping taking part in the invasion of &lt;unk&gt;. Two &lt;unk&gt; shot down or damaged three &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary ; the next day both &lt;unk&gt; were themselves shot down by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was bombed by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese for the first time on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and attacked regularly thereafter, damaging some aircraft. The intact &lt;unk&gt; were withdrawn to Darwin but &lt;unk&gt; and his staff remained at &lt;unk&gt; to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia. On &lt;unk&gt; February, &lt;unk&gt; was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to &lt;unk&gt; the airfield with assistance from &lt;unk&gt; Force. He returned to Darwin the following day, just as the city experienced its first raid by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. Four of No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters, where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against &lt;unk&gt;apanese targets in Timor. &lt;unk&gt; remained in Darwin as &lt;unk&gt; of Operations at Headquarters North &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Western Area Command until &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, when he was posted to &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, as commanding officer of No. &lt;unk&gt; Air Navigation School, operating Ansons. No. &lt;unk&gt; ( Reserve &lt;unk&gt; Squadron was formed from the school &lt;unk&gt;s personnel in &lt;unk&gt;une. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; took command of No. &lt;unk&gt; Air Observer School ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, also operating Ansons, at Mount Gambier, South Australia.

During his term as &lt;unk&gt;, the RAAF began re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. The Air Force also underwent a major &lt;unk&gt; change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; control system to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of Home ( operational &lt;unk&gt;, Training, and Maintenance &lt;unk&gt;. Eastern Area Command, considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the &lt;unk&gt; of combat units under its control, was reorganised as Home Command in October &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; New Year Honours for his &lt;unk&gt; exceptional ability and devotion to duty &lt;unk&gt;.

In this role &lt;unk&gt; occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service &lt;unk&gt;s controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. He was also one of two RAAF representatives to serve on a committee, chaired by businessman William &lt;unk&gt;ohn Allison, examining conditions of defence service ; the committee &lt;unk&gt;s recommendations led to a doubling of flight pay, among other improvements. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s other positions at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and Director General Plans and Policy from &lt;unk&gt;anuary to August &lt;unk&gt;. The latter assignment put him in charge of the RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s Directorate of Intelligence. &lt;unk&gt; was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ueen &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Honours, &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une.

He took over as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Air &lt;unk&gt;ice Marshal &lt;unk&gt; Hancock in April. &lt;unk&gt; was promoted to air vice marshal on &lt;unk&gt; May. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, he was posted to RAAF Base &lt;unk&gt;, Malaya, and took up the appointment of AOC No. &lt;unk&gt; Group RAF in Singapore one week later. He was succeeded as AOC &lt;unk&gt; by Air &lt;unk&gt;ice Marshal &lt;unk&gt; Murdoch. As AOC No. &lt;unk&gt; Group, &lt;unk&gt; had overall responsibility for regional air defence and offensive air operations during the &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion in December &lt;unk&gt;, and the subsequent &lt;unk&gt; between Indonesia and Malaysia that officially began the following month. &lt;unk&gt; from his first wife in &lt;unk&gt;, he married widowed social worker &lt;unk&gt;ernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;.

His tenure as &lt;unk&gt; coincided with the most significant &lt;unk&gt; program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia &lt;unk&gt;s increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt;, in March &lt;unk&gt; to plan the deployment. The year before, &lt;unk&gt; had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to &lt;unk&gt;ietnam for &lt;unk&gt; purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed &lt;unk&gt;, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered &lt;unk&gt; for its army co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operation role when it finally did deploy. &lt;unk&gt; succeeded Air &lt;unk&gt;ice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. Support Command had been formed in &lt;unk&gt;, by merging the RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s former Training and Maintenance &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was posted to London as Head of the Australian &lt;unk&gt;oint Services Staff.

He made his home in Melbourne, where he died aged &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, after a lengthy battle with cancer. &lt;unk&gt; by his children and his second wife, he was given a private funeral and &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Home Made &lt;unk&gt; Pie &lt;unk&gt; Home Made &lt;unk&gt; Pie is a &lt;unk&gt; American silent short comedy produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more &lt;unk&gt;, but three people each add brandy to the &lt;unk&gt;. Everyone becomes &lt;unk&gt; upon eating the &lt;unk&gt;, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one &lt;unk&gt; split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It states : &lt;unk&gt; Life in a country town is often tedious and &lt;unk&gt;, and were it not for the little &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The &lt;unk&gt; thought well of this established feature. They made it a &lt;unk&gt; occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an &lt;unk&gt; of the good things of life, but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On the night before such an event neither &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, or &lt;unk&gt; Gale could get those minutes &lt;unk&gt; solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests &lt;unk&gt; comfort. At the first &lt;unk&gt; of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the &lt;unk&gt; into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; - the &lt;unk&gt; were ever looking after the need of the said &lt;unk&gt;. First &lt;unk&gt; Gale would &lt;unk&gt; to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir ; then &lt;unk&gt; Gale would &lt;unk&gt; over and give it a stir ; finally &lt;unk&gt; Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to &lt;unk&gt; Gale that the beloved &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had not received its &lt;unk&gt;. Off she speeds to a &lt;unk&gt; of whiskey in the kitchen. She &lt;unk&gt; into the &lt;unk&gt; the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then &lt;unk&gt; Gale remembers that the &lt;unk&gt; has not been flavored. He, too, &lt;unk&gt; himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred &lt;unk&gt;. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than &lt;unk&gt; Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten &lt;unk&gt;, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the right proportion &lt;unk&gt; in, too. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced &lt;unk&gt; employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O &lt;unk&gt;Neil. Film historian &lt;unk&gt;. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many &lt;unk&gt; Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late &lt;unk&gt;, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Martin &lt;unk&gt;. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, &lt;unk&gt;ohn W. Noble, Anna &lt;unk&gt;, Mrs. George Walters. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The single reel comedy, approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet long, was released on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The film likely had a wide national release, with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The film would also be shown in &lt;unk&gt;ancouver, Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre. In &lt;unk&gt;, years after the film &lt;unk&gt;s release, the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of &lt;unk&gt; of Moving Pictures. The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long, but did not find it to be a fault. The reviewer states, &lt;unk&gt; A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of &lt;unk&gt;, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this &lt;unk&gt;. What happened to the guests who &lt;unk&gt; of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;!... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. &lt;unk&gt; as well as &lt;unk&gt; were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to &lt;unk&gt; out to anyone. &lt;unk&gt; Walton of The Moving Picture News was not &lt;unk&gt; by the plot and stated, &lt;unk&gt; To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, &lt;unk&gt; This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation.... A weak point in the story is the fact that the &lt;unk&gt; is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two &lt;unk&gt; would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; ( sometimes referred to as Hen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a ruined chapel near &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Anglesey, north Wales, dating back to the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. The chapel &lt;unk&gt;s original purpose is unknown, but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court, or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population. It was used for a time until the early &lt;unk&gt;th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house, then later fell into disrepair. The walls still remain, with some traces of render on them internally, but there is no roof. It contains a &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century side chapel with a vault beneath, used as a burial chamber. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to &lt;unk&gt; buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &lt;unk&gt;, in particular because it is &lt;unk&gt; a substantially &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century structure &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; unusual &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century vaulted south chapel &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History and location &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The oldest parts of Capel &lt;unk&gt; date from the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west Wales were first built in stone following the end of &lt;unk&gt;iking raids and attempts by the &lt;unk&gt; to gain control of the island. The reason for its construction, and the saint to whom it was dedicated, are unknown. Geraint &lt;unk&gt;ones, author of a &lt;unk&gt; guide to the churches of Anglesey, suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel, or connected to a royal court nearby. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, authors of a &lt;unk&gt; guide to ancient Anglesey monuments, note that it was built in the large parish of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times. Despite this, it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right. The chapel is sometimes referred to as &lt;unk&gt; Hen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; hen &lt;unk&gt; being the Welsh word for &lt;unk&gt; old &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meaning &lt;unk&gt; chapel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The walls were partially rebuilt in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and the upper parts of the walls date from this time. A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family, the Pierce &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the vault was used to record some &lt;unk&gt; atmospheres &lt;unk&gt; for the album &lt;unk&gt; You Have &lt;unk&gt;ust Been &lt;unk&gt; By The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by The &lt;unk&gt;, a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the &lt;unk&gt;, Super &lt;unk&gt; Animals and &lt;unk&gt; that was described by one journalist as &lt;unk&gt; possibly the &lt;unk&gt; pop group of all time &lt;unk&gt;. For a time, Capel &lt;unk&gt; was used as a private place of worship for &lt;unk&gt; House, a &lt;unk&gt; venerable mansion &lt;unk&gt; once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;st Baron Boston, in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. After the early part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, however, the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair. The walls remain to gable level, with some traces of render on the inside, but the roof has gone. Capel &lt;unk&gt; is in the Anglesey countryside near &lt;unk&gt; ; the parish church of St &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; is about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away. Part of the churchyard wall remains, showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure, as often found with early churches. It is cared for by Cadw, the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales, and is open to the public. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Architecture and fittings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; is built from rubble masonry ; at about &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; up the walls, the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks, showing where the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century rebuilding started. The doorway is on the south side, headed by a plain arch, and dates from the &lt;unk&gt;th century. There is a stone bellcote at the west end. There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat &lt;unk&gt; and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located &lt;unk&gt;. There are no window openings on the north side, but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide &lt;unk&gt; and there are the remains of a window on the south wall. There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel. The vault, which is about &lt;unk&gt; square feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel. &lt;unk&gt; slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above. A stone in the nave, about &lt;unk&gt; square feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a hole in the top, might once have been used as a churchyard cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Assessment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Capel &lt;unk&gt; has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building &lt;unk&gt; the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating &lt;unk&gt; buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them &lt;unk&gt;. It was given this status on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and has been listed because it is &lt;unk&gt; important as a substantially &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century structure, with some architectural details surviving from this early period &lt;unk&gt;, even though it is now in a &lt;unk&gt; ruinous condition &lt;unk&gt;. Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists &lt;unk&gt; also notes the &lt;unk&gt; unusual &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century vaulted south chapel &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century antiquarian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey. She said that the architecture was of &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; kind, &lt;unk&gt; which &lt;unk&gt; bears testimony to its great antiquity. &lt;unk&gt; She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins, and when it was dug out, the vault was discovered, &lt;unk&gt; containing several human skeletons, which &lt;unk&gt; into dust, when exposed to the air &lt;unk&gt;. She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed &lt;unk&gt; a large mass of human bones, several feet in depth &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey, and calls Capel &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously &lt;unk&gt; with the spirit of a pagan past &lt;unk&gt;. It notes that &lt;unk&gt; the wheel has turned full circle and Capel &lt;unk&gt; today is just another ruined relic of a former age. &lt;unk&gt; The authors describe the chapel as a &lt;unk&gt; simple, square building &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; small and &lt;unk&gt; austere south chapel &lt;unk&gt;, adding that the stone slabs over the vault are &lt;unk&gt; almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; c. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a Chinese artist, &lt;unk&gt; and publisher. He worked in calligraphy, traditional Chinese painting, and seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving, but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work. Hu lived in &lt;unk&gt; during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor &lt;unk&gt;s personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s capture and death in &lt;unk&gt;. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio, in which he practised various multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; colour printing and &lt;unk&gt; techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s work at the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio pioneered new techniques in colour &lt;unk&gt;, leading to delicate &lt;unk&gt; of colour which were not previously &lt;unk&gt; in this art form. Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt;, an artist &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; which remained in print for around &lt;unk&gt; years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Biography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu was born in &lt;unk&gt; County, Anhui Province in &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. Both his father and elder brother &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, art name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt;, and after he turned &lt;unk&gt; he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around Lu &lt;unk&gt;an and &lt;unk&gt;. It is commonly stated that &lt;unk&gt; himself was also a doctor, though the earliest sources &lt;unk&gt; to this occur only in the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. By &lt;unk&gt;, Hu had moved to &lt;unk&gt; where he lived with his wife Wu. Their home on &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, now also known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a hill located just within the northern city wall, served as a meeting &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; house for like &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minded artists. Hu named it the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property. It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business, where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, art name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and his sons &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, courtesy name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. During Hu &lt;unk&gt;s lifetime, the Ming dynasty, which had ruled China for over &lt;unk&gt; years, was overthrown and replaced by China &lt;unk&gt;s last imperial dynasty, the &lt;unk&gt;ing. Following the fall of the capital Beijing in &lt;unk&gt;, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in &lt;unk&gt; with Zhu &lt;unk&gt; on the throne as the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor. Hu, who was noted for his seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving and facility with seal script, created a seal for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a reward, but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in some of his subsequent personal seals &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Lost History of the South ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the &lt;unk&gt;ing invasion of &lt;unk&gt; Hu studied at the National &lt;unk&gt;niversity there, and whilst a student was employed by the Ministry of &lt;unk&gt; to record official &lt;unk&gt; ; he produced the Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning ( &lt;unk&gt;in Ban &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Record of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as part of this work. As a result, he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; Academy, but before he could take up this appointment, Beijing had fallen to the &lt;unk&gt; rebellion. Since contemporaneous biographies ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s work was not published until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu &lt;unk&gt;s death. Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in &lt;unk&gt;, after the end of the Ming dynasty. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recorded visiting him during his later years, in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; respectively. He died in poverty at the age of &lt;unk&gt;, sometime around late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; carving &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt; was a noted seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, and he followed the &lt;unk&gt; school of carving founded by his contemporary He &lt;unk&gt;. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear &lt;unk&gt; structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. &lt;unk&gt; seals attempt to &lt;unk&gt; an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other &lt;unk&gt; artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s work was known outside his local area. Zhou &lt;unk&gt;, a poet who lived in &lt;unk&gt; around the same time as Hu and was a noted art &lt;unk&gt;, stated in his Biography of Seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Hu &lt;unk&gt; creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure &lt;unk&gt;, implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor, which he carved after a period of &lt;unk&gt; and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the Great &lt;unk&gt; of the Seal ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which he &lt;unk&gt; the loss of the &lt;unk&gt; Emperor &lt;unk&gt;s seal and &lt;unk&gt; Heaven &lt;unk&gt;s favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; footed couplets ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; used in the Imperial examinations, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Despite his reputation as an artist and seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Hu was primarily a publisher. His publishing house, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio, produced reference works on calligraphy, poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books on etymology and &lt;unk&gt; ; and copies of as well as commentaries on the Confucian Classics. &lt;unk&gt;nlike other publishers in the area, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels. This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio &lt;unk&gt;s location : the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( National Academy &lt;unk&gt;, which provided a captive market for academic texts. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind, aimed at a wealthy, literary audience. The studio &lt;unk&gt;s earliest publications were medical textbooks, the first of which, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was published in &lt;unk&gt; and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later. Hu &lt;unk&gt;s brother &lt;unk&gt; was a medical &lt;unk&gt; and appears to have been the author of these books. During the &lt;unk&gt; the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio also produced political works &lt;unk&gt; the rule of the Ming ; these included the Imperial Ming Record of &lt;unk&gt; ( Huang Ming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a biography of loyal Ming officials, and the &lt;unk&gt; of the Imperial Ming ( Huang Ming &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a list of Imperial &lt;unk&gt;. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Hu renamed the studio the Hall &lt;unk&gt; in the Past ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty, although the Ten &lt;unk&gt; imprint continued to be used. Despite Hu &lt;unk&gt;s withdrawal from society after &lt;unk&gt;, the studio continued to publish well into the &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty, for the most part &lt;unk&gt; on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu &lt;unk&gt;s carving work. The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China. At his studio, Hu &lt;unk&gt; experimented with various forms of &lt;unk&gt; printing, creating processes for producing multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; coloured prints and &lt;unk&gt; printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China &lt;unk&gt;s first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; block printing &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, &lt;unk&gt; process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy &lt;unk&gt; and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing called &lt;unk&gt; set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which had existed since the Yuan period some &lt;unk&gt; years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for &lt;unk&gt; some of the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; of shades which were not previously possible. In some images, Hu employed a blind &lt;unk&gt; technique ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designs &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; blocks &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, using an &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu &lt;unk&gt;s contemporary Wu &lt;unk&gt;, who was also a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book Wisteria Studio &lt;unk&gt; Paper ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. Both Hu and Wu used &lt;unk&gt; to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a &lt;unk&gt; income for the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major works &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hu &lt;unk&gt;s most notable work is the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an anthology of around &lt;unk&gt; prints by around thirty different artists ( including Hu himself &lt;unk&gt;, published in &lt;unk&gt;. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic &lt;unk&gt;, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for &lt;unk&gt; to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a &lt;unk&gt; and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block printing methods to obtain &lt;unk&gt; of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the &lt;unk&gt; butterfly binding &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; style, whereby whole &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;niversity Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, &lt;unk&gt;. Said Charles &lt;unk&gt;, Head of the Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;niversity Chinese Department, &lt;unk&gt; The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was &lt;unk&gt;, we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it &lt;unk&gt; despite its &lt;unk&gt; importance to scholars. &lt;unk&gt; This volume went on to influence colour printing across China, where it paved the way for the later but better &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; known Manual of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Garden ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and also in &lt;unk&gt;apan, where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; e of the colour &lt;unk&gt; printing process known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; e &lt;unk&gt;. The popularity of the Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late &lt;unk&gt;ing dynasty. Hu also produced the work Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio &lt;unk&gt; Paper ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a collection of paper samples, which made use of the &lt;unk&gt; stamped &lt;unk&gt; technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief. Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers, it also contained paintings of rocks, people, ritual vessels and other subjects. The book was bound in the &lt;unk&gt; wrapped back &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; style, in which the &lt;unk&gt; pages are folded, stacked, and &lt;unk&gt; along the open edges. Originally published in &lt;unk&gt;, it was reissued in four volumes between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Lu &lt;unk&gt;, and revised and republished again in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Other publications &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Other works produced by Hu &lt;unk&gt;s studio included a reprint of Zhou &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s manual of seal &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; script calligraphy, The Six &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the related &lt;unk&gt; Investigations into &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; Bi &lt;unk&gt;i, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother &lt;unk&gt;, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the Confucian classics, entitled The &lt;unk&gt; Text of the Four Books, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the &lt;unk&gt; of the Thousand Character Classic in Six &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li &lt;unk&gt;. It was published after Li &lt;unk&gt;s death, partly in homage to him. The three Hu brothers worked together to &lt;unk&gt; a student &lt;unk&gt; on poetry by their contemporary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was called simply the &lt;unk&gt; of Poetry ( Shi Tan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Other works on poetry from the studio included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Selected Tang Poems ( &lt;unk&gt; Tang Shi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included &lt;unk&gt; by Hu &lt;unk&gt; himself. Among the studio &lt;unk&gt;s more obscure publications was a text on Chinese &lt;unk&gt; entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gallery &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; Studio Manual of Painting and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a song by English musician &lt;unk&gt; Starr, released as a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; album single in March &lt;unk&gt;. Starr &lt;unk&gt;s former Beatles &lt;unk&gt; George Harrison produced the recording, which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s Concert for Bangladesh shows in August &lt;unk&gt;. The single was a follow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up to Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; hit song &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt; and continued his successful run as a solo artist. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; peaked at number &lt;unk&gt; in Britain and Canada, and number &lt;unk&gt; on America &lt;unk&gt;s Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt;. It remains Starr &lt;unk&gt;s highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; charting single in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. The title for the song was inspired by English singer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; songwriter Marc &lt;unk&gt;. Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney, reflecting Starr &lt;unk&gt;s disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; demonstrates the influence of &lt;unk&gt; rock on Starr, who directed a documentary film, Born to Boogie ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s band T. Rex around this time. Described by one author as a &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; energy in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; face rocker &lt;unk&gt;, the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus &lt;unk&gt;. Starr re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for his &lt;unk&gt; album Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses, in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as &lt;unk&gt; With a Little Help from My Friends &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Good Day Sunshine &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Baby, You &lt;unk&gt;re a Rich Man &lt;unk&gt;. The original version has appeared on Starr &lt;unk&gt;s compilation albums &lt;unk&gt; from Your Past and &lt;unk&gt; : The &lt;unk&gt;ery Best of &lt;unk&gt; Starr, and as a bonus track on his remastered &lt;unk&gt; studio album &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ienna. Since his return to touring in &lt;unk&gt;, Starr has performed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regularly in concert with the various &lt;unk&gt; of his All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Starr Band. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr identified his initial inspiration for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as having come from Marc &lt;unk&gt;, the singer and guitarist with English &lt;unk&gt; rock band T. Rex. In a &lt;unk&gt; interview with &lt;unk&gt; editor Paul Du &lt;unk&gt;, Starr described &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; a dear friend who used to come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon &lt;unk&gt;. Over dinner one evening at Starr &lt;unk&gt;s home outside London, &lt;unk&gt; had used the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; so often that it stuck in Starr &lt;unk&gt;s mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on &lt;unk&gt;H&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, Starr explained : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was an &lt;unk&gt; guy. He used to speak : &lt;unk&gt; Back off &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; you, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Do you want some potatoes? &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; you, &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children &lt;unk&gt;s toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song. The lyrics to the middle eight of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television &lt;unk&gt;s football show, The Big Match. The program &lt;unk&gt;s host, &lt;unk&gt;immy Hill, often referred to a footballer &lt;unk&gt;s playing as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : Get yourself together now And give me something &lt;unk&gt; Everything you try to do You know it sure sounds wasted. Commentators have interpreted the song, and particularly this statement, as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles &lt;unk&gt; Paul McCartney. Starr has denied any such interpretation, instead &lt;unk&gt; claiming that the song was inspired by &lt;unk&gt; and nothing more &lt;unk&gt;, Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes. Starr had publicly criticised McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s solo albums McCartney ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Ram ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on release, and author Bruce &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the message of the middle eight as &lt;unk&gt; a plea for Paul to produce better music &lt;unk&gt;. The mention of &lt;unk&gt; sound &lt;unk&gt; ing &lt;unk&gt; wasted &lt;unk&gt; could also be a reference to McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; with cannabis, Rodriguez suggests. A further example of Starr &lt;unk&gt;s allegedly anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; McCartney message exists in the song &lt;unk&gt;s first verse : Wake up, &lt;unk&gt; Don &lt;unk&gt;t pretend that you are dead Get yourself up off the cart. The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Paul Is Dead &lt;unk&gt; hoax. The latter &lt;unk&gt; circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm, &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a &lt;unk&gt; divorce &lt;unk&gt; from the Beatles. In addition to these supposed messages in &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, observers have viewed the song title as Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March &lt;unk&gt; after a High Court judge found in McCartney &lt;unk&gt;s favour. Author Keith &lt;unk&gt; writes that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had &lt;unk&gt; long been cited as Paul &lt;unk&gt;s nickname &lt;unk&gt; from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics &lt;unk&gt; just happened to fit perfectly into the &lt;unk&gt; us vs. Paul &lt;unk&gt; mindset &lt;unk&gt; following the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; break &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up, to the extent that &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; Early &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had been &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. When &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; composition &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;m the Greatest &lt;unk&gt; for Starr to record on the album &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Lennon referenced the song title with the lines &lt;unk&gt; Now I &lt;unk&gt;m only thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; two &lt;unk&gt; And all I want to do is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although &lt;unk&gt; T Rex devotees &lt;unk&gt;, in the words of Starr biographer Alan &lt;unk&gt;, claimed that &lt;unk&gt; had ghost &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; written &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody. As on Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; hit single &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution. Starr originally offered &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to fellow &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Black to record, but she declined, hoping instead to record another new Starr &lt;unk&gt; Harrison composition, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Recording &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Having earmarked the song as his next single, Starr recorded &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;, following his appearance at the Harrison &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York. The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London, with Harrison producing, as he had on &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;. The recording reflects the influence of &lt;unk&gt; rock on Starr through what authors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Mark Easter term &lt;unk&gt; its big drum sound and &lt;unk&gt; nature &lt;unk&gt;, with a line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up comprising Starr ( vocals, drums, percussion &lt;unk&gt;, Harrison ( guitars &lt;unk&gt;, Gary Wright ( piano &lt;unk&gt; and Klaus &lt;unk&gt; ( bass, saxophone &lt;unk&gt;. Rodriguez describes Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; martial &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sounding opening &lt;unk&gt; as a rare &lt;unk&gt; showcase for his own drumming &lt;unk&gt;, while Harrison biographer Simon &lt;unk&gt; writes of &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; For the single &lt;unk&gt;s B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side, Starr had already written and recorded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the theme song for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; Western of the same name, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh. Starr produced the track with &lt;unk&gt;. The sessions for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took place at Apple on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; August, with &lt;unk&gt; guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and &lt;unk&gt;. Like the film &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the song is held in low regard by critics ; &lt;unk&gt; describes it as &lt;unk&gt; a muddy &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sounding &lt;unk&gt; with little to recommend &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Apple Records issued the single on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; in Britain, as Apple R &lt;unk&gt;, with a &lt;unk&gt;S release taking place three days later, as Apple &lt;unk&gt;. It was Starr &lt;unk&gt;s first release since &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, a year before. During this period, his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Further &lt;unk&gt; himself with Britain &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; rock movement, Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a film starring &lt;unk&gt; that included Starr &lt;unk&gt;s footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on &lt;unk&gt; March. With &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, NME critic Bob &lt;unk&gt; noted Starr &lt;unk&gt;s success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; break &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up, and wrote that the single &lt;unk&gt; confirmed that he and Harrison, dark horses both, were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; compared with McCartney and Lennon. The song was a hit in the &lt;unk&gt;S, reaching number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt;, and achieved Starr &lt;unk&gt;s best position on the &lt;unk&gt;K Singles Chart, where it reached number &lt;unk&gt;. A promotional video for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was shot on &lt;unk&gt; March at Lennon &lt;unk&gt;s Tittenhurst Park residence while Starr was looking after the property. The video, which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like monster, was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by &lt;unk&gt; Films. A similar monster appeared on the single &lt;unk&gt;s picture sleeve, holding a cigarette. Alan &lt;unk&gt; writes of reviewers criticising &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for being &lt;unk&gt;, leading Starr to respond in a &lt;unk&gt; interview : &lt;unk&gt; Play me a pop song that isn &lt;unk&gt;t. &lt;unk&gt; On release, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : &lt;unk&gt; A Number One hit could easily be in store for the &lt;unk&gt; of rock drums. There &lt;unk&gt;s a touch of the Marc &lt;unk&gt; in this highly playable rhythmic &lt;unk&gt;... It &lt;unk&gt;s hypnotic and effective, ideal for &lt;unk&gt; and liable to send us all mad by the end of the week. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; described the single as &lt;unk&gt; every bit as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;, although &lt;unk&gt; slightly inferior &lt;unk&gt;, while Mike &lt;unk&gt; of AllMusic views it as a song where &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt; spirit of &lt;unk&gt; Starr shines through &lt;unk&gt;. In a &lt;unk&gt; article for the NME, Charles &lt;unk&gt; Murray highlighted &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; great radio and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; box tune &lt;unk&gt;. Among &lt;unk&gt; biographers, Simon &lt;unk&gt; terms it &lt;unk&gt; a rocking, soccer crowd chant that suited Starr &lt;unk&gt;s talents well &lt;unk&gt;, and Bruce &lt;unk&gt; praises the track as a &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; energy in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; face rocker propelled by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; drums and George &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; slide guitar &lt;unk&gt;. In the &lt;unk&gt; publication NME &lt;unk&gt; : Beatles &lt;unk&gt; The Solo Years &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Paul Moody listed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; first among Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; ten solo gems &lt;unk&gt; and described it as &lt;unk&gt; Good time rock &lt;unk&gt; to match the Faces &lt;unk&gt;. Guitar World editor Damian &lt;unk&gt; includes the song on his list of Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s ten best post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Beatles &lt;unk&gt; Guitar &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, saying of the recording : &lt;unk&gt; the main event is clearly Harrison &lt;unk&gt;s slightly wild, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and very &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; slide guitar solo, which includes an alternate melody line that &lt;unk&gt;s even &lt;unk&gt; than the melody &lt;unk&gt; is singing. &lt;unk&gt; Re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; releases for &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; include Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; greatest hits album, &lt;unk&gt; from Your Past, and, along with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as a bonus track on the &lt;unk&gt; reissue of his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ienna album ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also appeared on his &lt;unk&gt; compilation &lt;unk&gt; : The &lt;unk&gt;ery Best of &lt;unk&gt; Starr, the collector &lt;unk&gt;s edition of which included his &lt;unk&gt; video for the song. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses version &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr recorded a new version of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for his &lt;unk&gt; album on &lt;unk&gt; Records, Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses. The song was produced by Starr &lt;unk&gt;s friend, singer Harry Nilsson, and features a musical arrangement by &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; Parks. Similar to Nilsson &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; cover of the Beatles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; You Can &lt;unk&gt;t Do That &lt;unk&gt;, the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band &lt;unk&gt;s songs &lt;unk&gt; in this case, &lt;unk&gt; With a Little Help from My Friends &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Help! &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Lady Madonna &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Good Day Sunshine &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Baby, You &lt;unk&gt;re a Rich Man &lt;unk&gt;, as well as Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt;. In a further reference to his past, the &lt;unk&gt; version of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on &lt;unk&gt; It Don &lt;unk&gt;t Come Easy &lt;unk&gt; ten years before. Starr taped the basic track at &lt;unk&gt; Recording Studios in Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;, with additional recording taking place on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December at Nassau &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Point Studios. Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson ( vocals &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im &lt;unk&gt; ( drums &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; ( piano &lt;unk&gt;, Dennis &lt;unk&gt; and Richie &lt;unk&gt; ( guitars &lt;unk&gt;, and a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; piece horn section led by saxophonist &lt;unk&gt;erry &lt;unk&gt;. Starr &lt;unk&gt; his vocals on &lt;unk&gt; December, four days before the murder of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon, who had been due to record his contributions to Stop and &lt;unk&gt; the Roses in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; with his success as a solo artist in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the album continued Starr &lt;unk&gt;s run of commercial and critical failures since &lt;unk&gt; ; Rodriguez writes that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people either love or hate the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Starr has performed &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in concert with his All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Starr Band, beginning with the band &lt;unk&gt;s debut tour of North America in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. The song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour, however, in favour of the &lt;unk&gt; Lennon &lt;unk&gt; McCartney composition &lt;unk&gt; I Wanna Be Your Man &lt;unk&gt;. Live versions of &lt;unk&gt; Back Off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have appeared on the multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; disc compilation The Anthology...

The latter version was recorded during a &lt;unk&gt;S tour in August &lt;unk&gt;, at which point the All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Starr line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up was Starr ( vocals &lt;unk&gt;, Mark Rivera ( saxophone &lt;unk&gt;, Ian Hunter ( guitar &lt;unk&gt;, Roger Hodgson and Howard &lt;unk&gt;ones ( keyboards &lt;unk&gt;, Greg Lake ( bass &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; E.

A version recorded on &lt;unk&gt; May that year at Sony Music Studios, New York, appeared on Starr &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;H&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; live album and video, released in October &lt;unk&gt;.

It runs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; from an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Garden State Parkway in &lt;unk&gt;pper Township, Cape May County to an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City, Atlantic County. The route, which is mostly a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road, passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; City, &lt;unk&gt; Manor, and Mays Landing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intersects several roads, including Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Mays Landing, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township. The portion of current Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Petersburg received funding in &lt;unk&gt; to become a spur of the Ocean Highway. In &lt;unk&gt;, what is now Route &lt;unk&gt; was designated a part of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;, a route that was to run from Cape May to &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City. Route &lt;unk&gt; was designated onto its current alignment in &lt;unk&gt;, replacing this portion of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a freeway was proposed for Route &lt;unk&gt;, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township. This proposal was canceled by the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic. The interchange between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange, with completion in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; begins at an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; section of &lt;unk&gt;pper Township, Cape May County, heading to the north on a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road. From the southern terminus, a ramp provides access to and from the southbound Garden State Parkway. The road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings. It intersects CR &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; before coming to a junction with CR &lt;unk&gt;. Later, Route &lt;unk&gt; Cedar Swamp Creek in an area of &lt;unk&gt;. At this crossing, the road runs closely parallel to a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg, where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a &lt;unk&gt; with CR &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;pon leaving Petersburg, Route &lt;unk&gt; turns to the north again and crosses over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operations railroad line, intersecting CR &lt;unk&gt;. It continues to &lt;unk&gt; and comes to CR &lt;unk&gt;. Past this intersection, the route meets CR &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; forms a concurrency with CR &lt;unk&gt; and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt; before leaving &lt;unk&gt;. Not far after Route &lt;unk&gt;, the road crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River into &lt;unk&gt; City, Atlantic County. In &lt;unk&gt; City, it heads into residential areas, with CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the west of the route. Route &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt; continue northwest and intersect CR &lt;unk&gt;, where the road turns north into more forested areas. At the junction with CR &lt;unk&gt;, the route turns to the northeast and enters &lt;unk&gt; Manor, becoming Broad Street. CR &lt;unk&gt; splits from Route &lt;unk&gt; by heading northwest on Buena &lt;unk&gt; Road and Route &lt;unk&gt; heads through some agricultural &lt;unk&gt; concurrent with CR &lt;unk&gt; Truck, passing to the west of the &lt;unk&gt; Wildlife Area, which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds. The route intersects CR &lt;unk&gt;, turning to the northeast. After passing some homes and Stephen Lake, the road turns to the north and passes to the west of &lt;unk&gt; Manor County Park. The route crosses the South River into &lt;unk&gt; Township, passing the residential community of &lt;unk&gt; to the east and meeting CR &lt;unk&gt;. It soon enters Hamilton Township, where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Harding Highway &lt;unk&gt;. CR &lt;unk&gt; Truck heads to the west on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; at this point while Route &lt;unk&gt; heads east on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, and CR &lt;unk&gt; continues north. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; follow the Harding Highway, a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road, turning to the northeast and crossing the Great &lt;unk&gt; Harbor River. &lt;unk&gt;pon passing over the river, enters Mays Landing and turns north, encountering CR &lt;unk&gt; before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing. Here, the road crosses CR &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; splits from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by turning east along that road. Meanwhile, Route &lt;unk&gt; continues north on Cape May Avenue, passing through developed areas. It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests. The route turns to the northeast, passing near the &lt;unk&gt; Leaf Lakes residential development, before coming to an interchange with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Black Horse Pike &lt;unk&gt;. Past this interchange, Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway. The route becomes a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas, crossing into Galloway Township, where there is an intersection with CR &lt;unk&gt;. A short distance later, the road crosses New &lt;unk&gt;ersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City Station and enters &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City, turning into Philadelphia Avenue. A block after the railroad crossing, Route &lt;unk&gt; ends at an intersection with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and CR &lt;unk&gt; ( White Horse Pike &lt;unk&gt;, with CR &lt;unk&gt; continuing north on Philadelphia Avenue at this point. Route &lt;unk&gt; is an important route linking the Atlantic City Expressway with the &lt;unk&gt;ersey Shore resorts in Cape May County, serving as an alternate to more &lt;unk&gt; routes. It also serves as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the event of a hurricane. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The portion of current Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Petersburg received funding to become a spur of the Ocean Highway in &lt;unk&gt;. The modern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; was legislated as part of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, a route that was to run from Cape May to &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City. In the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering, the portion of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Harbor City was designated as Route &lt;unk&gt;, the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering. Route &lt;unk&gt; retained its current routing in the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering. A freeway was proposed for Route &lt;unk&gt; around &lt;unk&gt;, running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township. This proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the &lt;unk&gt;ersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware &lt;unk&gt;alley. However, this freeway was canceled by the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route &lt;unk&gt;. On November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, construction began on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the Atlantic City Expressway. This project was completed on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native football team &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. It mostly comprised players of M&lt;unk&gt;ori ancestry, and also included some &lt;unk&gt; ( white New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt;. A wholly private &lt;unk&gt;, the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player &lt;unk&gt;oseph &lt;unk&gt;, promoted by civil servant Thomas &lt;unk&gt;, and managed by &lt;unk&gt;ames Scott, a &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; were the first New Zealand team to perform a &lt;unk&gt;, and also the first to wear all black. They played &lt;unk&gt; rugby matches during the tour, as well as a small number of &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia. Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby, the &lt;unk&gt; were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in &lt;unk&gt;. After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt;, the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez. The M&lt;unk&gt;ori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race, but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori &lt;unk&gt; as they had expected. Playing their first match, on &lt;unk&gt; October against Surrey, the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule, and frequently played three matches per week. Their early matches included a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Middlesex, but their form improved in November, when they won &lt;unk&gt; of their &lt;unk&gt; matches. The team played its first international match on &lt;unk&gt; December, against Ireland, and won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams, Yorkshire, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat against the Wales national team. By &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; had played &lt;unk&gt; matches in less than three months, winning &lt;unk&gt; of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England, where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable. In a return match on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; heaviest losses, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat. The team then went undefeated until &lt;unk&gt; February, when they faced England. Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( RF&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders, regarding them as unsportsmanlike, and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international, during which the RF&lt;unk&gt; secretary George Rowland Hill, &lt;unk&gt; the game, awarded a number of controversial tries to England, prompting three of the &lt;unk&gt; to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; apologised afterwards for their behaviour, but the damage was not repaired. The New Zealanders left England without an official send &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off, and travelled to Australia where they toured &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. They then returned to New Zealand, where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before. They went &lt;unk&gt; games undefeated before losing their final match, on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Auckland. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; final record in rugby matches was &lt;unk&gt; wins, &lt;unk&gt; draws and &lt;unk&gt; losses. They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home, and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion in &lt;unk&gt;. Seventeen of the team &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; players went on to play &lt;unk&gt; in New Zealand, and two, Thomas &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The idea for assembling a team of M&lt;unk&gt;ori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by &lt;unk&gt;oseph &lt;unk&gt;, a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in &lt;unk&gt;. He initially proposed a team of M&lt;unk&gt;ori or part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori to play the touring British side in &lt;unk&gt; ; this developed into a venture to have a M&lt;unk&gt;ori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful. &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plans, civil servant Thomas &lt;unk&gt; contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which &lt;unk&gt; accepted. When &lt;unk&gt;ames Scott, a &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that &lt;unk&gt; would be the team &lt;unk&gt;s captain, Scott its manager and &lt;unk&gt; its promoter. &lt;unk&gt; started assembling a team for the tour in early &lt;unk&gt;. He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability, and failed to secure the talented &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; due to his university commitments. Some M&lt;unk&gt;ori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori. Twenty M&lt;unk&gt;ori or part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori players joined the squad ; five &lt;unk&gt; ( white New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; players were added after the team lost to Auckland. Due to the inclusion of these &lt;unk&gt; players the team was renamed from the &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Native Football Representatives &lt;unk&gt;. The final squad comprised &lt;unk&gt; players ( including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; of these at least five were full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori, while fourteen had a M&lt;unk&gt;ori mother and a &lt;unk&gt; father. The parentage of some of the players is unknown. The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas, playing against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay, Auckland, Nelson, Wellington, Canterbury, South Canterbury, and &lt;unk&gt;. The first game was contested against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay in Napier on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand, and won seven of them. Their last New Zealand match before departure, against &lt;unk&gt; played in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, was won by one try to nil. The team sailed for Australia from &lt;unk&gt;, leaving on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. In Melbourne, Scott recruited &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; to train the players in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches on their return to Australia. The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion team, winning the first and drawing the second, before continuing to Britain via Suez. They arrived in London on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in England and early matches &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators, including an official of England &lt;unk&gt;s Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( RF&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first match of the tour was against Surrey, where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a &lt;unk&gt;, and also the first to wear an all black uniform. That the team was predominantly M&lt;unk&gt;ori provoked curiosity from the British press &lt;unk&gt; at the time, most Britons had not seen non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white people &lt;unk&gt; but there was some surprise that the team were not as &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;ori &lt;unk&gt; as had been expected. &lt;unk&gt; They are not unlike Europeans, &lt;unk&gt; a Scottish reporter wrote in November &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation &lt;unk&gt;. The Surrey match, which was &lt;unk&gt; by the RF&lt;unk&gt; secretary George Rowland Hill, was won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt; after they scored two tries. The &lt;unk&gt; next defeated both &lt;unk&gt; and Kent, before defeats by &lt;unk&gt; and Burton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Trent. Both defeats were unexpected, and in the &lt;unk&gt; match, injuries played a part &lt;unk&gt; the tourists played most of the match at least two men down, as replacements were then not allowed. The team recovered to win their next game, against Midlands Counties in Birmingham. Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public, and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park, &lt;unk&gt;. The Middlesex side contained a number of international players, including Arthur Gould. Middlesex won easily, with the &lt;unk&gt; play characterised by poor tackling. The final score was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders. Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine &lt;unk&gt; an indulgence the &lt;unk&gt; were not used to. A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition &lt;unk&gt; of scratch players, whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully collected the best possible team available. Such &lt;unk&gt; passing &lt;unk&gt; as the Home men displayed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; admit they have never previously witnessed. Said &lt;unk&gt; whilst we were on the platform waiting for the London train, &lt;unk&gt; I think they would have just beaten us, even if we had been in good form. &lt;unk&gt; Following the match against Middlesex, the team travelled to the north, where the strongest English rugby teams were based. Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RF&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; over the issue of &lt;unk&gt; broken time &lt;unk&gt; payments. The New Zealanders lost to Hull &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, defeated &lt;unk&gt;, then lost to Wakefield. After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County &lt;unk&gt; they defeated Stockton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt; appeared in the match against &lt;unk&gt;, but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point. These victories were followed by a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat to Halifax on &lt;unk&gt; November. The team then won seven matches in a row, including one against &lt;unk&gt; RFC, their only Scottish opposition of the tour. The last two matches that month were a loss to &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory over Liverpool and District. The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them. By this point, the team was beset by injuries &lt;unk&gt; of the fifteen players that played against &lt;unk&gt; County on &lt;unk&gt; November, five had injuries. The squad comprised only &lt;unk&gt; players, and the tourists were often struggling to field a side. Nevertheless, their heavy schedule continued ; on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; they left for Dublin, where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ireland, further English matches, and Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. Both teams had a number of leading players out injured &lt;unk&gt; the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection. Ireland led &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time after scoring a converted try, but the &lt;unk&gt; improved considerably in the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half, scoring four tries. Patrick &lt;unk&gt; scored the first two tries, and his play was praised by the local press. The third try scored was by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; after a counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack by George Williams. The try was not converted, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the &lt;unk&gt; Home Nations Championship. Following their defeat of Ireland, the &lt;unk&gt; played Trinity College and then North of Ireland. The match against Trinity College was drawn &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and despite &lt;unk&gt; not playing, the Native side played much better than their previous fixture. The team then travelled to Belfast, where they defeated North of Ireland &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; December ; scoring two tries to nil. After returning to England, the &lt;unk&gt; faced Lancashire in Manchester, where they lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Two days later they drew with &lt;unk&gt; Bulldogs, despite their opposition scoring five tries. Their next match was against Yorkshire, who were one of the strongest counties in the country, and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season. Yorkshire fielded a weakened team, and were subsequently defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;, who scored six tries. After a further two victories, the team travelled to Wales, where they lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, before facing Wales on &lt;unk&gt; December. At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and &lt;unk&gt; feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players. Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time, and out of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; had been selected. The match was played in Swansea, and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd, with gate receipts of only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recorded. The crowd &lt;unk&gt;s hostility impacted on the players, and &lt;unk&gt; Norman &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; nervous &lt;unk&gt; at the start of the match. &lt;unk&gt;, aged &lt;unk&gt; years and &lt;unk&gt; days, became the youngest Welsh international player &lt;unk&gt; a record he held until the debut of Tom &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Despite the &lt;unk&gt; aimed primarily at &lt;unk&gt;, Charlie Arthur and George Thomas, the Welsh team produced an excellent effort, especially from the forwards. Towers scored the first Welsh try, which was converted by &lt;unk&gt;im Webb. The &lt;unk&gt; replied with a spirited run by &lt;unk&gt;, but he failed to break through the Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a &lt;unk&gt; try &lt;unk&gt; the half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way line, which went some way to silence the &lt;unk&gt; from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The &lt;unk&gt; continued to push, with Elliot coming within five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yards of the try line, and when &lt;unk&gt; did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the ball into the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing &lt;unk&gt;im &lt;unk&gt; to score. &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game. The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed. In the &lt;unk&gt; Home Nations Championship Wales had &lt;unk&gt; the four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again tried the four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter system against the &lt;unk&gt;, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter style of play. Before they left Wales, the &lt;unk&gt; played Swansea and two other local clubs, Newport, and Cardiff. They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales, and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spectators. They finished their Welsh matches, and the year, with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to England &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The side entered &lt;unk&gt; having played &lt;unk&gt; matches for &lt;unk&gt; wins and three draws. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement. The team would go on to play a further &lt;unk&gt; matches before their &lt;unk&gt; February international against England. &lt;unk&gt;anuary started with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; loss to Bradford, during which &lt;unk&gt; police officers were required to keep many of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spectators, many of them non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; paying, in order. This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Rangers, and Huddersfield. Following further matches against &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, where the team drew, lost, then won, the side faced Yorkshire for a second time. Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up against the &lt;unk&gt; when the sides first met in December. After the unexpected loss, Yorkshire were determined to make &lt;unk&gt; and a strong side was selected for the county, including Fred &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Willie &lt;unk&gt;, all of whom would appear for England against the &lt;unk&gt; later that season. Described as &lt;unk&gt; knocked about &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; stale &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; struggled to compete against such strong opposition, and Yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to &lt;unk&gt; left the scores at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time. The second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half was little better for the &lt;unk&gt; ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal. The second of these tries was scored by &lt;unk&gt; after he ran the ball from his own half. &lt;unk&gt; scored a converted try late in the match, but this didn &lt;unk&gt;t prevent the &lt;unk&gt; suffering their largest defeat of the tour : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; later described the match as &lt;unk&gt; without a &lt;unk&gt;, the biggest beating we received in our whole tour &lt;unk&gt;. After a victory over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;alley District, the team travelled west to play &lt;unk&gt;, Devonshire, Taunton, and Gloucestershire, and won all five games. The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt; largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. Half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back &lt;unk&gt; played outstandingly for the &lt;unk&gt;, while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition. Devonshire and &lt;unk&gt; suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed. After defeating Midland Counties, the &lt;unk&gt; returned to London. The team had two further matches before their international against England. The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England, &lt;unk&gt;. Andrew &lt;unk&gt;, who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the &lt;unk&gt; British Isles side, played for the club in their &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; defeat to the &lt;unk&gt;. The New Zealanders won having scored four tries, including two by &lt;unk&gt;. Their next opposition was a &lt;unk&gt;nited Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players. The &lt;unk&gt; were again victorious, this time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The match against Oxford &lt;unk&gt;niversity was postponed due to heavy &lt;unk&gt;, and so the team had a seven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day break from playing &lt;unk&gt; their longest of the tour. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; England international &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The match against England was causing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; players and management problems before it had even begun. The team manager, Scott, was in dispute with the RF&lt;unk&gt; over where the match should be played &lt;unk&gt; the RF&lt;unk&gt; were adamant that the match should take place at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ground, but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval, where a larger crowd, and therefore higher gate receipts, could be secured. The strictly amateur RF&lt;unk&gt; establishment were already suspicious of the profit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; making motives of the &lt;unk&gt;, and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue. The RF&lt;unk&gt; was also in dispute with the other Home &lt;unk&gt; over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Following a disputed try in an England &lt;unk&gt; Scotland international match in &lt;unk&gt;, the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game, but the RF&lt;unk&gt; insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote, arguing that they deserved this as they were, they asserted, the senior body, and had the most member clubs. Ireland, Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until &lt;unk&gt;, when, following arbitration, the RF&lt;unk&gt; relented and joined the &lt;unk&gt;. The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The line &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ups selected for the &lt;unk&gt; February match were both strong, and close to full strength. Though &lt;unk&gt; of the England side had not played internationally before, all were experienced at domestic level. The match was &lt;unk&gt; by Rowland Hill, who had also &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; first match in Britain, against Surrey. The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair, with much tackling and &lt;unk&gt; on the heavy ground. Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford, but both were disputed by the &lt;unk&gt;, who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal. England took the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; try advantage into the second half. Early in the second half a third disputed try was scored by the English. The try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the &lt;unk&gt; and the RF&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to tackle the English player &lt;unk&gt;, and in the process ripped his shorts off. The &lt;unk&gt; quickly formed a circle around &lt;unk&gt; to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank &lt;unk&gt;, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming &lt;unk&gt; had called &lt;unk&gt; dead ball &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but Hill awarded the try, prompting three of the Native players, Dick &lt;unk&gt;, Williams, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to leave the field in protest. The &lt;unk&gt; players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had &lt;unk&gt; play. &lt;unk&gt; was very critical of Hill, particularly because he was also Secretary of the RF&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; wrote after the tour that &lt;unk&gt; gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; at all in that game &lt;unk&gt;. The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English, who ultimately won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The RF&lt;unk&gt;, at Hill &lt;unk&gt;s instigation, promptly demanded an apology from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; captain of the day, Edward &lt;unk&gt;, who had led the team as &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt; was injured. The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RF&lt;unk&gt; threatened to bar any of their affiliated players &lt;unk&gt; in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England &lt;unk&gt; from facing the &lt;unk&gt; if they did not &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another, four days after the game : The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders &lt;unk&gt; approach to the game ; reports of rough and over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; aggressive play by the &lt;unk&gt; had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt;, accused the RF&lt;unk&gt; and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to &lt;unk&gt; the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later matches and departure from England &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on &lt;unk&gt; February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford &lt;unk&gt;niversity. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over &lt;unk&gt;, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground &lt;unk&gt; said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; win, the &lt;unk&gt; suffered a loss to Barrow and District on &lt;unk&gt; March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; draw with Hull. &lt;unk&gt; were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists &lt;unk&gt; last match in northern England. The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. This was their &lt;unk&gt; match in the British Isles and their &lt;unk&gt;th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the &lt;unk&gt; boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived &lt;unk&gt; from the RF&lt;unk&gt; provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team &lt;unk&gt;s official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The majority of the &lt;unk&gt; left Plymouth on &lt;unk&gt; March ( &lt;unk&gt; and Pie &lt;unk&gt; followed a week later &lt;unk&gt;. They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; to coach them in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the &lt;unk&gt; were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules &lt;unk&gt;, ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition. The side &lt;unk&gt;s success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Rules &lt;unk&gt; the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in &lt;unk&gt;ictoria : against Melbourne, a Navy selection, and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria. The matches were all won, with their game against &lt;unk&gt;ictoria a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victory. After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches, and defeated New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After two further victories, the side again faced New South Wales, and won the match &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Another two victories followed, before the team played their only association football matches of the tour &lt;unk&gt; both defeats. The team travelled north to &lt;unk&gt;ueensland, where, as in New South Wales, rugby was the dominant code of football. Consequently, the team exclusively played rugby while in the region. The &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt;ueensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane. The &lt;unk&gt; spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the &lt;unk&gt; to win &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the &lt;unk&gt; did not exert themselves in the win, and the score did not reflect their dominance. After a further two matches, against &lt;unk&gt; and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated &lt;unk&gt;, the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. In contrast to their first meeting, the first &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half was a close affair, and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half. Billy &lt;unk&gt; suffered a kick to the head, and had to retire early in the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half. Following the loss of &lt;unk&gt;, the play of the &lt;unk&gt; improved and they recovered to win &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; to throw the game. &lt;unk&gt; later said : It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought, in racing &lt;unk&gt;, to be playing &lt;unk&gt; stiff &lt;unk&gt;, and that they had been got by some &lt;unk&gt; ; at all events, when accused of it at half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time and cautioned, they played a different game in the second half. The response from the team &lt;unk&gt;s management was to suspend four players. The team travelled to &lt;unk&gt;, where they defeated the locals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; included a replacement player for only the second time, Charles &lt;unk&gt;, after the &lt;unk&gt; reduced the playing strength of the side. The team then travelled back to New Zealand, and arrived in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Two days after their return, the &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt;, who they defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in front of a crowd of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The side suffered further injury, to Harry Lee, and recruited &lt;unk&gt; W. &lt;unk&gt; for their match against &lt;unk&gt; District on &lt;unk&gt; August. Despite playing the match two players down, the &lt;unk&gt; comfortably defeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Following the side &lt;unk&gt;s return to New Zealand, the &lt;unk&gt; Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion demanded that the team &lt;unk&gt;s management explain the accusations levelled at them in &lt;unk&gt;ueensland. &lt;unk&gt; responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted, and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred. The Northern Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion ( since renamed &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt; summarised the incident and aftermath in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion Annual :... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the &lt;unk&gt;, as they were not showing their usual dash and combination. Four members of the team were suspended, a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match. The matter was bought before the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;nion, who passed the following resolution : That, having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team, and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management, we are of opinion that there are no facts before us &lt;unk&gt; the allegations... It is unlikely, given the attitude of the &lt;unk&gt; Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion to the &lt;unk&gt; before their departure, that they would have dismissed the allegations if &lt;unk&gt; evidence had existed. The side was back to full strength following the return of their suspended players when the side faced &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; their opponents five tries to two, and won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The side &lt;unk&gt;s star player and half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; back, &lt;unk&gt;, stayed in &lt;unk&gt; when the team departed for &lt;unk&gt;. The side faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Bay, who were touring, in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; defeated them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; play was praised by The Press : &lt;unk&gt;... the &lt;unk&gt; of the black passed with remarkable accuracy and &lt;unk&gt; between their legs, over their shoulders, under their arms and with their feet &lt;unk&gt;. The side then faced Canterbury on &lt;unk&gt; August, who they &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The report published in The Press said of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performance : The play showed on Saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition of what several months of combination and practice will do... it must be admitted they were far and away too good for our local men. In the loose, in the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, passing, &lt;unk&gt;, or running they were very much indeed Canterbury &lt;unk&gt;s superior. Such runs as were made by &lt;unk&gt; at full back, by Madigan, &lt;unk&gt;, and W. &lt;unk&gt;, the passing of H. &lt;unk&gt;, F. &lt;unk&gt;, and all the backs as well as several forwards, the rushes of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Maynard, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; powers of nearly every one, &lt;unk&gt; their opponents... The side left &lt;unk&gt; and travelled north where they played &lt;unk&gt; in Masterton. The match was won &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the next day they faced Wellington, who they also defeated. The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the &lt;unk&gt; all profit from the match. After this the &lt;unk&gt; travelled to Auckland where they played their last match, against the province on &lt;unk&gt; August. The match was lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after each team scored two tries each, but the &lt;unk&gt; kicked a drop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; goal and a conversion. The loss ended a remarkable run of matches &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; had a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March ; the side won &lt;unk&gt;, and drew one match between the defeats. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Impact and legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand. It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere, and the longest in the history of the sport. By the time the &lt;unk&gt; returned to New Zealand, they had developed into a side superior to any in the country, and introduced a number of tactical innovations. Seventeen of the &lt;unk&gt; players went on to play &lt;unk&gt; in New Zealand, and two, &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt;, subsequently captained New Zealand. The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt;, later renamed New Zealand Rugby &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides. The &lt;unk&gt; sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team, captained by &lt;unk&gt;, to tour Australia in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; are also the &lt;unk&gt; of the M&lt;unk&gt;ori All Blacks, a representative team organised by the &lt;unk&gt;, that first played in &lt;unk&gt;. The Native team, along with &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt;, was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the seventh &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Squad &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The squad consisted of &lt;unk&gt; players.

She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik &lt;unk&gt;, Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky, including the title role in the latter &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The niece of Lady &lt;unk&gt; and Sir Wilfrid &lt;unk&gt;, who also were her patrons, she initially trained and performed in Europe. She then travelled to &lt;unk&gt;ava and for four years immersed herself in its native music, which she introduced to North American audiences on her return. She retired from performing in &lt;unk&gt;, and opened a voice studio in New York, where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors. &lt;unk&gt; was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music. The citation from the &lt;unk&gt; Society of San Francisco, which she received in &lt;unk&gt;, said : &lt;unk&gt;... her rare open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Singing career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Born in Ottawa, Ontario, &lt;unk&gt; received musical lessons as a child, in harmony, voice, and piano. The custom of the time dictated that North American musicians travel to Europe for training if they desired a &lt;unk&gt; professional career, and in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, at the age of seventeen, &lt;unk&gt; set out for Europe, financed by her aunt and uncle, Lady &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Sir Wilfrid &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training in Europe &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; travelled to France, where she received private voice lessons from Auguste &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ean &lt;unk&gt; of the Paris &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; on her vocal &lt;unk&gt; were problematic, but they were removed &lt;unk&gt;. She later began training under &lt;unk&gt;acques &lt;unk&gt;, whom she would later credit for her vocal technique. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour. Albani provided a degree of &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; week tour of Canada. Lord &lt;unk&gt; awarded &lt;unk&gt; a scholarship in &lt;unk&gt; that allowed her to return to Europe and continue her vocal studies. She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. Her first operatic performance came in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Italy as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Carmen. She landed a second operatic role as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. The opera opened in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; soprano of the company, feared that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s voice would &lt;unk&gt; her own, and demanded that &lt;unk&gt; be removed from the opera. The company &lt;unk&gt;s director &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s demands, informing &lt;unk&gt; on opening night that she would not be performing. &lt;unk&gt; reacted badly, and quit opera entirely. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;ava &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, &lt;unk&gt; departed Europe and travelled to &lt;unk&gt;ava. There, she met a Dutch &lt;unk&gt; and plantation manager named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; married on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; studied the music of &lt;unk&gt;ava, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul &lt;unk&gt;, who had previously been the conductor for the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, which afforded &lt;unk&gt; a number of opportunities. On permission of the &lt;unk&gt;avanese court, she studied the &lt;unk&gt;, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in &lt;unk&gt;ava, &lt;unk&gt; travelled extensively, giving performances in China, &lt;unk&gt;apan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in &lt;unk&gt;ava for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Return to North America &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Arriving in New York, &lt;unk&gt; struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in &lt;unk&gt;audeville entitled &lt;unk&gt;, which combined &lt;unk&gt; music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so &lt;unk&gt; focused on her &lt;unk&gt; musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. &lt;unk&gt; began giving annual recitals at &lt;unk&gt; Hall, and in November &lt;unk&gt; her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a &lt;unk&gt;... sensitive &lt;unk&gt; of interesting, &lt;unk&gt; songs &lt;unk&gt;. She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky &lt;unk&gt;s Three &lt;unk&gt;apanese Lyrics and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five Poems of Ancient China and &lt;unk&gt;apan. The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have &lt;unk&gt; to premiere all of his vocal pieces. &lt;unk&gt; travelled to Paris in &lt;unk&gt; at the behest of the Music League of America. &lt;unk&gt; there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik &lt;unk&gt; and Les six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a refusal to perform &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by Arnold &lt;unk&gt;. Through this, &lt;unk&gt; performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. &lt;unk&gt; toured America frequently and returned to Europe in &lt;unk&gt;, and again in &lt;unk&gt;. She began to explore &lt;unk&gt;azz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics. Her &lt;unk&gt; annual performance at &lt;unk&gt; Hall entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Ancient and Modern Music for &lt;unk&gt;oice &lt;unk&gt; became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George &lt;unk&gt;, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by Arnold &lt;unk&gt;, Darius &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Paul &lt;unk&gt;. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by &lt;unk&gt;erome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George &lt;unk&gt; : I &lt;unk&gt;ll &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; to Paradise, Innocent &lt;unk&gt; Baby, and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included &lt;unk&gt; Schumann &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;irgil Thomson, and Paul &lt;unk&gt;. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include &lt;unk&gt;azz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. &lt;unk&gt; continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences. On some occasions, such as her performances of &lt;unk&gt; in New York in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, as well as in London in &lt;unk&gt;, this was quite successful. A critic in &lt;unk&gt;ienna welcomed her musical selection as a &lt;unk&gt; from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, &lt;unk&gt;, Wolf, Richard &lt;unk&gt; - while praising her skill with more classical choices. Other performances suffered &lt;unk&gt; she was &lt;unk&gt; while performing works by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;illa &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in &lt;unk&gt;enice. She became a celebrity, and continued giving performances across the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, Europe, and her native Canada. On the &lt;unk&gt; anniversary of Canadian Confederation in &lt;unk&gt;, she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first &lt;unk&gt; radio broadcast in Canada. Although she toured Canada from time to time, and attended performances of Canadian music in New York, she held a negative opinion of Canada &lt;unk&gt;s treatment of native musicians, saying &lt;unk&gt; Canadians... would rather listen to foreigners than their own people. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the stage &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Illness forced &lt;unk&gt; to halt giving performances in the late &lt;unk&gt;s, but she would return to the stage in &lt;unk&gt;, giving a concert in Havana, Cuba. As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching, and less and less in stage performing. Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring. She retired from performing entirely in &lt;unk&gt;, and opened a music studio in New York. There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists, serving on its board of governors. She died on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of critics and audiences &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was a controversial musician in her time. Her choice of music for performance was often condemned, and often praised. The &lt;unk&gt; of jazz music for a &lt;unk&gt; trained singer, combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to &lt;unk&gt; her for promoting otherwise overlooked music, and others to &lt;unk&gt; her for taking &lt;unk&gt; music into a &lt;unk&gt; venue. A May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; review by the New York Times praised her natural talent, with some reservations about the &lt;unk&gt; quality of her voice. Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : &lt;unk&gt;... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them. &lt;unk&gt; A November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs, as well as modern English, French, Austrian, German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music. The critic remarked &lt;unk&gt; Her voice was much too good for jazz. &lt;unk&gt; Here she was praised as a serious, scholarly artist whose performance was &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; and expressive. &lt;unk&gt; The audience received the concert very enthusiastically. Her performance in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; resulted in a headline in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the next day that was headed Eva &lt;unk&gt; ’ s Program &lt;unk&gt; Whole Town &lt;unk&gt; : Many People Are of Two &lt;unk&gt; Regarding &lt;unk&gt;azz Numbers &lt;unk&gt; Some &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; That They Like Them &lt;unk&gt; Others &lt;unk&gt; Silent or &lt;unk&gt; Them. The review divides the audience and critics into various camps : those who openly enjoyed and applauded the performance ; those who openly disliked and condemned it ; those unsure how to react to a performance they liked but felt was inappropriate ; and those who liked the performance but would not show approval for fear of looking foolish or &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; materials &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; papers, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music Division, The New York Public Library.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michigan Wolverines men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michigan Wolverines men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team represented the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Michigan during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Division I men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball season. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan at &lt;unk&gt; Center for the &lt;unk&gt; consecutive year. It had a seating capacity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

Fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year head coach &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; led the team, alongside All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten players Trey Burke, Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r. and Zack Novak. Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year and was Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first Associated Press All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American &lt;unk&gt; since &lt;unk&gt;. The team &lt;unk&gt;s season began with a preseason media day and practices in October &lt;unk&gt;. In February &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan hosted ESPN &lt;unk&gt;s College &lt;unk&gt; for the first time in a game against Ohio State. It was the eighth time a Big Ten team hosted the show, which began in &lt;unk&gt;. The team was in the national rankings all season and ended as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; champion with Michigan State and Ohio State. It had three victories over teams ranked in the top &lt;unk&gt; at the time of the meeting ( eighth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Memphis, ninth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Michigan State and sixth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Ohio State &lt;unk&gt;. The team was undefeated at home until its last home game of the season. Michigan lost in the semifinals of the &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Conference Tournament and bowed out in the second round of the &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Tournament to end the season with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; record. The team won the school &lt;unk&gt;s first Big Ten Conference Championship since the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season and had the school &lt;unk&gt;s best Big Ten record ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; since the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; incoming team members &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Before the season began, point guard Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists leader in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles &lt;unk&gt;. The incoming class included Carlton &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Ohio Mr. Basketball point guard Trey Burke. Both &lt;unk&gt; and Burke were among &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s top &lt;unk&gt; players of the &lt;unk&gt; class ; &lt;unk&gt; ranked &lt;unk&gt; and Burke ranked &lt;unk&gt;th. Max &lt;unk&gt; committed to Michigan in April despite his family &lt;unk&gt;s ties to the Illinois Fighting &lt;unk&gt;. Illinois &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who along with &lt;unk&gt; was recruited by &lt;unk&gt; League schools, rounded out the incoming class. &lt;unk&gt; earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on candidate for the basketball team. Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r., son of former NBA All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Star Tim &lt;unk&gt;, returned to the team. He was coming off a freshman season in which he was a unanimous Big Ten All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Freshman, All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten honorable mention, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; America and Team &lt;unk&gt;SA FIBA &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ordan &lt;unk&gt;, the son of Detroit Pistons All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Star &lt;unk&gt;oe &lt;unk&gt;, left the team, citing &lt;unk&gt; knee issues. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; team recruits &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Former team captains Travis &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and C.&lt;unk&gt;. Lee ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; served as director of basketball operations and administrative specialist, respectively. Peter &lt;unk&gt; was the team &lt;unk&gt;s video coordinator. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Schedule and results &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michigan announced its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; game non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conference schedule on August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The team began the season in a renovated &lt;unk&gt; Arena : new seats and a high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; definition &lt;unk&gt; were added, but seating capacity was reduced to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the previous &lt;unk&gt; seasons. Michigan came in third place in the three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; game &lt;unk&gt; Maui &lt;unk&gt; Tournament between November &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The team defeated the eighth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Memphis Tigers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, lost to the sixth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranked Duke Blue Devils &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and defeated the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; favorite &lt;unk&gt;CLA Bruins &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Tim &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;r. was named the Big Ten Player of the Week, and Trey Burke was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week. In an ACC &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Challenge game in late November, Michigan lost to &lt;unk&gt;irginia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In its next game, Michigan defeated Iowa State &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. On December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan beat Oakland &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, its highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scoring game since beating Northern Michigan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. It was also Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first game since &lt;unk&gt; with three &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; point scorers ( &lt;unk&gt;, Burke and Evan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Burke earned his second Freshman of the Week honor on December &lt;unk&gt; after scoring a season &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points and nine assists in the game. On the same day, Michigan was the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated Big Ten team in the Ratings &lt;unk&gt; Index, although the team trailed several schools in the national polls. In the final two non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conference games of the season, &lt;unk&gt; scored his first two double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; doubles against Alabama A &lt;unk&gt; M and Bradley on December &lt;unk&gt; and December &lt;unk&gt;. Heading into the Big Ten Conference schedule, both of the teams Michigan had lost to were ranked ( Duke was &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th in the AP and Coaches &lt;unk&gt; polls and &lt;unk&gt;irginia was &lt;unk&gt;rd and &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;. On December &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan won its first Big Ten Conference opener since &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, beating Penn State as &lt;unk&gt; extended his double &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; double streak to three games. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Burke earned his first Big Ten Conference Player of the Week honor and his third Freshman of the Week honor for his &lt;unk&gt; points in Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first two conference games. On December &lt;unk&gt; against Penn State he posted &lt;unk&gt; points, seven assists, five rebounds and no turnovers. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, he added a career &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shooting with three rebounds and three assists against Minnesota to earn Big Ten Conference Player of the Week the following day. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan became the leader in the conference with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; record, thanks to conference wins over ranked Wisconsin and Michigan State teams. Michigan remained in first place until losing to Ohio State ten days later. The team went &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in conference in February, including wins over ranked Indiana and Ohio State teams. Michigan lost its final home game of the season to &lt;unk&gt; on February &lt;unk&gt; to finish with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; home record. On March &lt;unk&gt;, the team defeated Illinois for their first road win in Illinois since &lt;unk&gt;. During the game, Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th of the season, Trey Burke broke Gary Grant &lt;unk&gt;s school freshman assists record, set over the course of &lt;unk&gt; games in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; season, by pushing his total to &lt;unk&gt;. In the first game of the &lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Conference Men &lt;unk&gt;s Basketball Tournament against Minnesota, Burke led the team to victory with a career &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt; points. Burke &lt;unk&gt;s total was a school record for the Big Ten Conference Men &lt;unk&gt;s Basketball Tournament. In the semifinal contest, however, Michigan was eliminated by Ohio State for the third year in a row. Michigan entered the &lt;unk&gt; NCAA Men &lt;unk&gt;s Division I Basketball Tournament &lt;unk&gt; fourth, but lost to the thirteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ohio Bobcats &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Burke became Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s first Associated Press All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American &lt;unk&gt; since Robert &lt;unk&gt; and Louis &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Douglass concluded the season as the school &lt;unk&gt;s all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time leader in games played, with &lt;unk&gt;. He surpassed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who played in &lt;unk&gt; games. Novak set the school record in career minutes played with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, surpassing Louis &lt;unk&gt;, who played &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; minutes. Burke had a school record &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; setting freshman season in assists, ending the year with &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team posted the following statistics : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rankings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five of the &lt;unk&gt; nominees for the men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball Lowe &lt;unk&gt;s Senior &lt;unk&gt; Award were from the Big Ten, including Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s Zack Novak. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; season &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trey Burke was one of nearly &lt;unk&gt; Bob &lt;unk&gt; Award candidates named in December &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Burke was one of &lt;unk&gt; finalists. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Novak was named one of ten finalists for the Lowe &lt;unk&gt;s Senior &lt;unk&gt; Award along with three other Big Ten athletes. He was also one of four Big Ten men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball players named Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District, putting him among the &lt;unk&gt; finalists for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; America team. Novak was named a third team Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accolades and honors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trey Burke &lt;unk&gt; Second Team All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American Big Ten Freshman of the Year ( Big Ten media &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Freshman of the Year ( Sporting News &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( second team, coaches and media &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Freshman ( unanimous &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District &lt;unk&gt; Team Tim &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( third team, coaches and media &lt;unk&gt; Zack Novak Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; District Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American ( third team &lt;unk&gt; All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten ( honorable mention, media &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten &lt;unk&gt;osh &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten Matt &lt;unk&gt; Academic All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Big Ten &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; changes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team lost senior captains &lt;unk&gt; Douglass and Zack Novak as well as senior reserve Corey Person to graduation following the season. Person was later granted an extra year of eligibility to return to the team. At the end of the season, three players ( Evan &lt;unk&gt;, Carlton &lt;unk&gt; and Colton Christian &lt;unk&gt; decided to leave the program. &lt;unk&gt;, who had started in &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; games he played in during his first two years, left the program as the program &lt;unk&gt;s fifth all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; point shooter with a percentage of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; transferred to Maryland, &lt;unk&gt; transferred to Detroit and Christian transferred to Florida International. Following the season, Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the &lt;unk&gt; NBA Draft. A few days later, however, the realization that the pool of point guards in the &lt;unk&gt; draft was shallow and Burke &lt;unk&gt;s stock was high led to some &lt;unk&gt; for him and his family : &lt;unk&gt; When you have a season as a freshman like he did, the NBA, they like them young, &lt;unk&gt; Trey &lt;unk&gt;s father, &lt;unk&gt; Burke said. &lt;unk&gt; They think their ceiling is higher when they &lt;unk&gt;re young. Trey had... a solid season for a freshman. It &lt;unk&gt;s going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years. &lt;unk&gt; Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential. Eventually, he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; team recruits &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The team announced in September &lt;unk&gt; that Glenn Robinson III, son of former first overall NBA Draft pick Glenn Robinson, verbally agreed to attend Michigan, making him the first commitment in the school &lt;unk&gt;s class of &lt;unk&gt;. Canadian wing guard &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gave Michigan its second verbal commitment for the class of &lt;unk&gt; on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. On November &lt;unk&gt;, Mitch &lt;unk&gt;, who was ranked as the number &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. Within hours of the commitment, ESPN said that Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s ranked as the fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; best class in the nation. All three signed a National &lt;unk&gt; of Intent with the team on November &lt;unk&gt;. After several other schools announced their commitments, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s commitment moved Michigan from outside the top &lt;unk&gt; to the seventh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; best class in the nation, according to ESPN. Michael &lt;unk&gt; Spike &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; committed to Michigan on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Team Players &lt;unk&gt; into the NBA &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b ( abbreviated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, &lt;unk&gt; And b &lt;unk&gt;, occasionally designated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;, also named &lt;unk&gt;, is an extrasolar planet approximately &lt;unk&gt; light &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; years away from the Sun in the constellation of &lt;unk&gt;. The planet orbits the Solar twin star, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A, approximately every five days. Discovered in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; by Geoffrey &lt;unk&gt; and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot &lt;unk&gt;upiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; resolved planets to be detected directly. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the International Astronomical &lt;unk&gt;nion launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the IA&lt;unk&gt; announced the winning name was &lt;unk&gt; for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the &lt;unk&gt;ega &lt;unk&gt; Club of Morocco and honours the &lt;unk&gt;th Century astronomer Ibn al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Muslim Spain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Discovery &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Like the majority of known extrasolar planets, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b was detected by the variations in its star &lt;unk&gt;s radial velocity caused by the planet &lt;unk&gt;s gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the &lt;unk&gt; shift of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s spectrum. The planet &lt;unk&gt;s existence was announced in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, together with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b and the planet orbiting &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Like &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; days to complete an orbit, with a &lt;unk&gt; axis of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A&lt;unk&gt;. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. In the case of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b, this lower limit is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the mass of &lt;unk&gt;upiter, though depending on the inclination of the orbit, the true mass may be much greater. However, astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the true mass may be about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is &lt;unk&gt; degrees. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Physical characteristics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given the planet &lt;unk&gt;s high mass, it is likely that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is a gas giant with no solid surface. The &lt;unk&gt; Space Telescope measured the planet temperature, and found that the difference between the two sides of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees &lt;unk&gt;, ranging from minus &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; degrees to about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees &lt;unk&gt;. The temperature difference has led to speculation that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b is &lt;unk&gt; locked with the same side always facing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A. &lt;unk&gt; had, on the assumption that the planet is similar to &lt;unk&gt;upiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium, predicted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b to have reflective clouds of &lt;unk&gt; and iron in its upper atmosphere. The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun &lt;unk&gt;s radiation ; between that and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, exists a &lt;unk&gt; of cooler gas. The outer shell of dark, &lt;unk&gt;, hot cloud is assumed to consist of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; oxides ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; planets &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but other compounds like &lt;unk&gt; cannot be ruled out yet. The planet is unlikely to have large moons, since &lt;unk&gt; forces would either &lt;unk&gt; them from orbit or destroy them on short &lt;unk&gt; compared to the age of the system. The planet ( with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b &lt;unk&gt; was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by &lt;unk&gt;. Preliminary results from &lt;unk&gt; studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; times as large and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; times as massive as &lt;unk&gt;upiter, meaning that the mean density is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm&lt;unk&gt;. It has a &lt;unk&gt; albedo of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in visible light. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on its sun &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; b appears to be responsible for increased &lt;unk&gt; activity on its parent star. Observations suggest that there is a &lt;unk&gt; hot spot &lt;unk&gt; on the star around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; away from the sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; planetary point. This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star. The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; variable stars, or the interaction between &lt;unk&gt;upiter and its moon Io.  &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Michigan highway &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the &lt;unk&gt;S state of Michigan that travels between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City. The section between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City travels through &lt;unk&gt; and along the southern edge of &lt;unk&gt; National Forest.

M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; exits the intersection to the east. The highway runs along &lt;unk&gt;th Street through rural farms into the community of &lt;unk&gt;. The road, now called Main Street, passes through the downtown area and M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town. The highway rounds a curve and transitions to &lt;unk&gt;nd Street running eastward through more farm land. As the trunkline approaches &lt;unk&gt;, the terrain becomes more wooded near the &lt;unk&gt; River. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; follows &lt;unk&gt; Street east to a junction with M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street. South of downtown, M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns east again, independent of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and runs along &lt;unk&gt;nd Street on the southern edge of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest. The east end of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is at exit &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of Howard City. The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT &lt;unk&gt;, as a part of its maintenance responsibilities, tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways. These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT &lt;unk&gt;, which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year. In &lt;unk&gt;, the department &lt;unk&gt;s measurements indicated that a segment of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of &lt;unk&gt; had the peak volume for the highway at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles daily. The traffic nadir was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles east of &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country &lt;unk&gt;s economy, defense, and mobility. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Previous designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The first usage of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was in the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula by &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The trunkline started at M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and ran north of &lt;unk&gt; to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner. It was later replaced by M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Current designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The current M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dates back to &lt;unk&gt;. It ran from &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Hart to the northern junction of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, replacing M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In late &lt;unk&gt;, M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was extended along the section between &lt;unk&gt; and Howard City, forming a M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; concurrency to fill a gap in the M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; routing. This concurrent section became just M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; back to the northern M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt;. The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt;. Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart, it was continued west to end in Shelby. Two &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; rerouted the western end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from &lt;unk&gt; to New Era, bypassing Ferry. A larger change around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the highway designations in &lt;unk&gt; County. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of &lt;unk&gt;, to end at New Era instead of &lt;unk&gt;. The new M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; south of &lt;unk&gt;. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; now ran from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; only. The length of the highway was increased in &lt;unk&gt; when the eastern end was moved back to Howard City. M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to follow the &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs, and replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between Cedar Springs and &lt;unk&gt;. This freed up the &lt;unk&gt; to Howard City highway for a return to the M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation. The last change came in &lt;unk&gt; when the concurrency with M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was eliminated in favor of M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of &lt;unk&gt;, resulting in the current highway routing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a fictional character in the &lt;unk&gt; manga and anime series created by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

North of the South &lt;unk&gt; Tunnel, it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a New &lt;unk&gt;ersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and &lt;unk&gt; County. The obsolete Delaware &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Canal usually stands between the river and the highway. Most sections of this portion of Route &lt;unk&gt; are completely &lt;unk&gt; due to the tree canopy. Route &lt;unk&gt; also has a spur, Route &lt;unk&gt;, which connects Route &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;.

The route between &lt;unk&gt; and Frenchtown was originally Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Route &lt;unk&gt; was shifted to follow the alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; to avoid the &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Routes. Route &lt;unk&gt; between South Warren Street in &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane highway, with a portion of freeway, in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt;, the southern freeway part of Route &lt;unk&gt; between I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township was completed. This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route &lt;unk&gt; by a tunnel completed in &lt;unk&gt;. A realignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;s made the route concurrent with the entire length of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mercer County &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate &lt;unk&gt; and Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township, and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, heading to the northwest as a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane freeway. The route interchanges with Route &lt;unk&gt;, a spur of Route &lt;unk&gt; which connects to &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt;, at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to four lanes past this interchange and crosses into &lt;unk&gt;. The route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for &lt;unk&gt; Road. At this point, Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes the Delaware River Scenic Byway, a state scenic &lt;unk&gt; that was also designated a National Scenic Byway in &lt;unk&gt;.

Within this tunnel, Route &lt;unk&gt; features a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lalor Street. The route emerges from the tunnel as the &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway, passes by Arm &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Park, and comes to a traffic light at Thunder Road &lt;unk&gt; Cass Street where it &lt;unk&gt; back to six lanes.

The freeway portion of Route &lt;unk&gt; ends at the intersection with Lee Avenue and it continues northwest along the Delaware River as a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway. The route meets the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Sullivan Way &lt;unk&gt;. The median &lt;unk&gt; again and then &lt;unk&gt; as the route meets the southern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt;, a former alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; that currently serves as a frontage road. Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses into Ewing Township and becomes the Daniel Bray Highway. It passes under the West &lt;unk&gt; Railroad Bridge, which carries &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ’ s West &lt;unk&gt; Line over the Delaware River. Route &lt;unk&gt; intersects Route &lt;unk&gt; again and then comes to a complex interchange with Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, with the ramps within the median of Route &lt;unk&gt;, just to the east of the &lt;unk&gt; Falls Bridge. &lt;unk&gt;pon crossing the Delaware and &lt;unk&gt; Canal, Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; down to a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane undivided road called River Road. It continues along the Delaware River, next to the Delaware and &lt;unk&gt; Canal, which runs between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the river. The route intersects the northern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt;. Farther north, Route &lt;unk&gt; enters &lt;unk&gt; Township and continues into a more rural setting &lt;unk&gt; with trees. Route &lt;unk&gt; heads to Washington Crossing State Park, where it intersects County Route &lt;unk&gt;, which heads east on Washington Crossing &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Road, and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge, which continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; continues north along the Delaware River through &lt;unk&gt;, passing by Washington Crossing State Park. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; County &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses into West &lt;unk&gt; Township in &lt;unk&gt; County. It enters &lt;unk&gt;, where Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane divided highway. At the intersection of South Main Street, Route &lt;unk&gt; becomes concurrent with Route &lt;unk&gt;. The route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Brunswick Street &lt;unk&gt;. It meets Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt;, where Route &lt;unk&gt; ends and Route &lt;unk&gt; turns west for a one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; block wrong &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way concurrency with the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane, undivided Route &lt;unk&gt;, lasting to the intersection of Main Street, where Route &lt;unk&gt; turns north on Main Street. Route &lt;unk&gt; follows Main Street north through &lt;unk&gt;, crossing into Delaware Township. It comes to an interchange with &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; just east of the New Hope &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge, with access to northbound &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; and from southbound &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; provided by way of &lt;unk&gt; Creek Road. Route &lt;unk&gt; continues along the Delaware River and enters Stockton. The route intersects Bridge Street, which crosses the Delaware River on the Centre Bridge &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Stockton Bridge and continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route &lt;unk&gt;. Shortly after that intersection, Route &lt;unk&gt; intersects the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Stockton &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Flemington Road &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; crosses back into Delaware Township, where it meets the southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Stockton Road &lt;unk&gt;. Route &lt;unk&gt; makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road, crossing into &lt;unk&gt; Township, where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway. Here, it intersects with County Route &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Road &lt;unk&gt;. The route &lt;unk&gt; to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles, crossing into Frenchtown, where the route becomes &lt;unk&gt; Road. &lt;unk&gt;pon entering Frenchtown, an end shield for northbound Route &lt;unk&gt; is posted to mark the end of state maintenance, which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection, where maintenance is transferred to the county. Despite this, Route &lt;unk&gt; officially continues farther north along &lt;unk&gt; Road to its northern terminus at Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt; Race Street &lt;unk&gt;, a short distance east of Route &lt;unk&gt; ’ s western terminus at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Frenchtown Bridge. The southern terminus of County Route &lt;unk&gt; is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route &lt;unk&gt; along Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The current route was originally legislated in &lt;unk&gt; as part of the Delaware River Drive, a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from &lt;unk&gt; to the New York border in &lt;unk&gt; Township. Route &lt;unk&gt; was originally defined in &lt;unk&gt; to run from &lt;unk&gt; to Newark. The original route ran from downtown &lt;unk&gt; along State Street and &lt;unk&gt; Drive. From there, it followed its current alignment to &lt;unk&gt;, where it followed present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Route &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; to present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day County Route &lt;unk&gt;, which it followed to Woods Tavern. The route turned north on &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( also designated Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and followed that route to &lt;unk&gt;, where it followed &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; to Newark. The current alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to Route &lt;unk&gt; in Frenchtown was designated Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; was eventually shifted to follow present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt;, which was also Route &lt;unk&gt; ( now Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Flemington and Route &lt;unk&gt; between Flemington and &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, Route &lt;unk&gt; was planned as an extension of Route &lt;unk&gt; from Frenchtown to Route &lt;unk&gt; ( now Route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Alpha. While this road was never built, much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, a spur route, Route &lt;unk&gt;, was created, running along &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; ( Bridge Street &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to the New Hope &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge. In the &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt;ersey state highway renumbering, Route &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to continue north from &lt;unk&gt; to Frenchtown on Route &lt;unk&gt;, and the Route &lt;unk&gt; designation between &lt;unk&gt; and Newark was removed in favor of &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Newark. The section of former Route &lt;unk&gt; between Route &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; became Route &lt;unk&gt;. Plans for a limited &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; access route along the Route &lt;unk&gt; corridor go back to &lt;unk&gt;, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ; this proposal never materialized. Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early &lt;unk&gt;s to construct a road, the &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway, that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township. This road was built between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; from South Warren Street in &lt;unk&gt; to present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Interstate &lt;unk&gt; in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion &lt;unk&gt;ohn Fitch Parkway took up much of &lt;unk&gt; ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River. The former alignment of Route &lt;unk&gt; in the northern part of &lt;unk&gt; and in Ewing Township became Route &lt;unk&gt;. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the Route &lt;unk&gt; freeway was built between the Interstate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interstate &lt;unk&gt; interchange and Route &lt;unk&gt; in Hamilton Township. A two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane street, &lt;unk&gt; Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in &lt;unk&gt;. Construction began in &lt;unk&gt; on the Route &lt;unk&gt; freeway between Route &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by &lt;unk&gt; but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October &lt;unk&gt; and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. A restriction to trucks over &lt;unk&gt; tons was put in place and made permanent in November &lt;unk&gt;. By the &lt;unk&gt;s, the state gave the part of Route &lt;unk&gt; ( South Main Street &lt;unk&gt; between Route &lt;unk&gt; and Route &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to the city, and Route &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to use all of Route &lt;unk&gt; and one block of Route &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to this, South Main Street had been turned one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way southbound. Route &lt;unk&gt;, which is only signed on overhead street signs, still exists, though it is fully concurrent with Route &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the &lt;unk&gt;.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin. The ultra &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; prominent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the highest peak in the &lt;unk&gt; Range and the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest summit in the contiguous &lt;unk&gt;nited States after Mount Whitney. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is located in San Isabel National Forest, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southwest ( bearing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the City of &lt;unk&gt; in Lake County, Colorado. The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. Henry W. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak, in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; or A &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is therefore often referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; gentle giant &lt;unk&gt; that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is visible to the southwest of &lt;unk&gt;, often snow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; capped even in the summer. Many other &lt;unk&gt; surround &lt;unk&gt; in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado &lt;unk&gt;s Collegiate &lt;unk&gt;. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest in the contiguous &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount &lt;unk&gt;, Denver is about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the east, &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the north, and &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the west. &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the northeast, is the nearest large town. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount &lt;unk&gt; is the fourteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; highest mountain in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the &lt;unk&gt; ; &lt;unk&gt; and snow are possible year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; round. An electrical storm on the mountain &lt;unk&gt;s summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; issue of Science. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; is part of the &lt;unk&gt; Range, an &lt;unk&gt; of the Laramide &lt;unk&gt; which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around &lt;unk&gt; million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily &lt;unk&gt;, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of &lt;unk&gt; on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and &lt;unk&gt; rocks deposited when the glaciers &lt;unk&gt;, which lie on a lateral &lt;unk&gt;. Further up the eastern side there is a large &lt;unk&gt; with a small &lt;unk&gt;. There are also lakes to both the north and south, &lt;unk&gt; and Twin Lakes respectively ; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and &lt;unk&gt; Lake was created by the &lt;unk&gt; Sugar &lt;unk&gt; Dam. Mount &lt;unk&gt; is composed largely of &lt;unk&gt;. However, the summit ridge consists of &lt;unk&gt; basement rock, which is Pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in origin and about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; billion years old. There are various igneous &lt;unk&gt; including &lt;unk&gt;, as well as &lt;unk&gt; bands &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, &lt;unk&gt; lacks both a permanent &lt;unk&gt; and a prominent north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; facing &lt;unk&gt;, which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mount &lt;unk&gt; was named by miners in honor of Samuel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the governor of the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; tribe that opened up more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of reservation land to mining and railroad activity. The first recorded ascent of the peak was by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, who was surveying the mountain as part of the &lt;unk&gt; Survey. Originally measured as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in height, Mount &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s elevation was later adjusted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; following a re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in &lt;unk&gt; as a result of the North American &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of &lt;unk&gt; and its neighbor, Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount &lt;unk&gt; proponents &lt;unk&gt; them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount &lt;unk&gt; has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first &lt;unk&gt; ascent of &lt;unk&gt; occurred in &lt;unk&gt;, when a &lt;unk&gt;eep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Flora and fauna &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The summit of Mount &lt;unk&gt; is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( sky &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pilot &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( old &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mountain &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( alpine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Also noted are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; album, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Below &lt;unk&gt; the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered with a mixture of lodgepole pine, spruce, &lt;unk&gt; and fir. Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears, &lt;unk&gt;, mule deer, &lt;unk&gt;, and pocket &lt;unk&gt; ; there are also many species of &lt;unk&gt;. Elk, grouse, turkey and &lt;unk&gt; sheep are present in the area during the summer. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are three main routes which ascend the mountain, all of which gain over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of elevation. The standard route &lt;unk&gt; the peak from the east, starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long North ( Main &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Trail begins close to the &lt;unk&gt; Creek &lt;unk&gt;, and gains about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. The trail is open to &lt;unk&gt;, mountain &lt;unk&gt; and hunters during season. An easier, but longer route, the South &lt;unk&gt; Trail, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long, climbing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; at a less &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; punishing gradient than the North &lt;unk&gt; Trail, approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge. The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail, a Class &lt;unk&gt; climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace, gains &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in elevation, and also involves an ascent of the sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; peak, South &lt;unk&gt;, at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. Even healthy and experienced &lt;unk&gt; report great difficulty on this route, and despite the fact that there is a trail, the route is extremely steep, unstable, and rocky in places. The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ascent. There are also routes approaching from the western face, and southwestern ridge, from South &lt;unk&gt; Creek &lt;unk&gt; and Echo Canyon &lt;unk&gt; respectively. Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness, none of the conventional routes require specialist &lt;unk&gt; skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, even those who are &lt;unk&gt;. In serious cases, it can lead to high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; altitude pulmonary &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, &lt;unk&gt;, and death. &lt;unk&gt; are advised to begin their ascent at or before &lt;unk&gt; a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the &lt;unk&gt;, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the &lt;unk&gt;.S. government.  &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; was the tenth tropical storm of the &lt;unk&gt; Atlantic hurricane season. &lt;unk&gt; developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August &lt;unk&gt;. The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde Islands on September &lt;unk&gt;. The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; around noon the same day. Over the next several days, &lt;unk&gt; moved in a general west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September &lt;unk&gt;. Strong wind shear, some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike, and dry air caused the storm to weaken. On September &lt;unk&gt;, the combination of wind shear, dry air, and cooling waters caused &lt;unk&gt; to weaken into a tropical depression. &lt;unk&gt; deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm. The low ultimately dissipated while located &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt; on September &lt;unk&gt;. However, the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meteorological history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August &lt;unk&gt;. It tracked south of Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde and slowly developed, and on September &lt;unk&gt; the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; six hours after forming. &lt;unk&gt; was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly. &lt;unk&gt; continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical. However, due to the location of the storm, there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was &lt;unk&gt; to significantly increase due to an upper &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of &lt;unk&gt;, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September &lt;unk&gt; as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger. &lt;unk&gt; reached its peak intensity of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; around &lt;unk&gt; a.m. ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it had already begun to weaken. &lt;unk&gt; towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of &lt;unk&gt; began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center. Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as &lt;unk&gt; continued westward and no change in intensity over the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and &lt;unk&gt; weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of &lt;unk&gt; was only a &lt;unk&gt; of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September &lt;unk&gt; into the morning of September &lt;unk&gt;, convection associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to &lt;unk&gt; somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong &lt;unk&gt; wind shear. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; morning, &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on &lt;unk&gt; by late morning. The convection around the system became &lt;unk&gt; from the center and &lt;unk&gt; weakened slightly. The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong &lt;unk&gt; shear. &lt;unk&gt; became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; afternoon and the storm weakened to &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;, barely holding on to tropical storm status. &lt;unk&gt; regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm &lt;unk&gt; over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with &lt;unk&gt; as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated. However, the remnant low associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September &lt;unk&gt;, wind shear took over the system again. &lt;unk&gt; around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September &lt;unk&gt;, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September &lt;unk&gt;, the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September &lt;unk&gt;, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Impact &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; As &lt;unk&gt; passed to the south of the Cape &lt;unk&gt;erde islands on September &lt;unk&gt;, outer rain bands produced minor rainfall, totaling around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inches ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor. Several days after the low dissipated, the remnant moisture from &lt;unk&gt; brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of rain fell. The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage was caused by the flood.  &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the twentieth spy film in the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond series, and the fourth and final film to star Pierce &lt;unk&gt; as the fictional MI&lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond. The film follows Bond as he leads a mission to North Korea, during which he is betrayed and, after seemingly killing a rogue North Korean colonel, is captured and imprisoned. Fourteen months later, Bond is released as part of a prisoner exchange. &lt;unk&gt; that someone within the British government betrayed him, he attempts to earn redemption by tracking down his &lt;unk&gt; and killing a North Korean agent he believes was involved in his torture. Die Another Day, produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee &lt;unk&gt;, marked the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond franchise &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary. The series began in &lt;unk&gt; with Sean Connery starring as Bond in Dr. No. Die Another Day includes references to each of the preceding films. The film received mixed reviews. Some critics praised the work of Lee &lt;unk&gt;, while others criticised the film &lt;unk&gt;s heavy use of computer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generated imagery, which they found &lt;unk&gt; and a distraction from the film &lt;unk&gt;s plot. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grossing &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond film up to that time if inflation is not taken into account. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; MI&lt;unk&gt; officer &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; infiltrates a North Korean military base, where Colonel Tan &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African blood &lt;unk&gt;. After Moon &lt;unk&gt;s assistant &lt;unk&gt; discovers that Bond is a British agent, the colonel attempts to kill Bond and a &lt;unk&gt; chase &lt;unk&gt;, which ends with Moon &lt;unk&gt;s apparent death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel &lt;unk&gt;s father, General Moon. After &lt;unk&gt; months of captivity and torture, Bond is traded for &lt;unk&gt; in a prisoner exchange. He is &lt;unk&gt; and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a &lt;unk&gt; Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under &lt;unk&gt;. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal. After escaping from the custody of MI&lt;unk&gt;, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from a Chinese agent that &lt;unk&gt; is in Cuba. In Havana Bond meets &lt;unk&gt; agent &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;inx &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring.

He leaves behind a &lt;unk&gt; which leads Bond to a &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, identified as conflict &lt;unk&gt;, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. At &lt;unk&gt; Club in London Bond meets Graves, along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI&lt;unk&gt; agent. After a fencing exercise ( and a literal sword &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fight &lt;unk&gt;, Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demonstration.

During the night, &lt;unk&gt;inx infiltrates Graves &lt;unk&gt; command centre, but is captured by Graves and &lt;unk&gt;. Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive. Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, assuming the identity of Gustav Graves. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing &lt;unk&gt; to escape from Graves &lt;unk&gt; facility. Bond then returns in his Aston Martin &lt;unk&gt; to rescue &lt;unk&gt;inx, who has been captured once again. &lt;unk&gt; pursues him in his own vehicle, both cars driving inside the rapidly melting ice palace. Bond kills &lt;unk&gt; by shooting an ice &lt;unk&gt; onto him, and then &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;inx after she has drowned. Bond and &lt;unk&gt;inx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and &lt;unk&gt; away on Graves &lt;unk&gt; cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the purpose of the Icarus satellite : to cut a path through the Korean &lt;unk&gt; Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the peninsula by force. &lt;unk&gt;, General Moon tries to stop the plan, but he is murdered by his own son. Bond attempts to shoot Graves but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board. In their struggle, a gunshot &lt;unk&gt; the fuselage, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Bond engages Graves in a fist fight, and &lt;unk&gt;inx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks &lt;unk&gt;inx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, &lt;unk&gt;inx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines, killing him and &lt;unk&gt; the Icarus beam. Bond and &lt;unk&gt;inx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, carrying away Graves &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; in the process. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cast &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pierce &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt;, an MI&lt;unk&gt; agent.

The film was shot primarily in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom, Iceland, and &lt;unk&gt;, Spain. Other locations included &lt;unk&gt; Studios &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stage and Maui, Hawaii, in December &lt;unk&gt;. Laird Hamilton, Dave &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performed the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; title surfing scene at the surf break known as &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Maui, while the shore shots were taken near &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves &lt;unk&gt; diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional &lt;unk&gt; de Los &lt;unk&gt; were filmed at La &lt;unk&gt;, Spain. The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in &lt;unk&gt;. The location was reportedly cold and &lt;unk&gt;, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick &lt;unk&gt; between takes to avoid catching a &lt;unk&gt;. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minute operation. &lt;unk&gt; and other props from every previous Bond film and stored in &lt;unk&gt; Productions &lt;unk&gt; archives appear in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s warehouse in the London &lt;unk&gt;nderground. Examples include the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and Rosa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s poison &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tipped shoe in From Russia with Love. &lt;unk&gt; mentions that the watch he issues Bond is &lt;unk&gt; your &lt;unk&gt;th, I believe &lt;unk&gt;, a reference to Die Another Day being the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced Bond film. In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the &lt;unk&gt; Club, MI&lt;unk&gt; Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, and Westminster. Svalbard, Norway and &lt;unk&gt;, Iceland were used for the car chase on the ice with additional scenes filmed at &lt;unk&gt; National Park, Norway and RAF Little &lt;unk&gt;, Gloucestershire ; &lt;unk&gt; Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the &lt;unk&gt; cargo plane scenes. The scene in which Bond &lt;unk&gt; the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene are computer &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generated. The hangar interior of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S Air Base in South Korea &lt;unk&gt;, shown crowded with &lt;unk&gt; helicopters, was filmed at RAF &lt;unk&gt; in Hampshire, &lt;unk&gt;K, as were the helicopter interior shots during the &lt;unk&gt; sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a &lt;unk&gt;S base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, &lt;unk&gt; ( one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape &lt;unk&gt; are flown by Bond and &lt;unk&gt;inx to &lt;unk&gt; enter North Korea.

The good guys get in &lt;unk&gt;, thanks to a fast cruise, good &lt;unk&gt; performance, and minimal radar signature. It &lt;unk&gt;s a wonderful promotion for the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records. He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for The World Is Not Enough. The first, originally used as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s theme, is heard during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the &lt;unk&gt; Christmas in Turkey &lt;unk&gt; track of The World Is Not Enough, is reused in the &lt;unk&gt; Going Down Together &lt;unk&gt; track. The title song for Die Another Day was co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; written and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo in the film as &lt;unk&gt;, a fencing instructor. This is the first Bond title sequence to directly reflect the film &lt;unk&gt;s plot since Dr. No ; all the other previous Bond titles are stand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; alone set pieces. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive &lt;unk&gt; months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics &lt;unk&gt; opinions of the song were sharply divided &lt;unk&gt; it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the &lt;unk&gt; Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, but also for a Golden &lt;unk&gt; Award for &lt;unk&gt; Original Song of &lt;unk&gt; ( while Madonna herself won the Golden &lt;unk&gt; Award for &lt;unk&gt; Supporting Actress for her cameo &lt;unk&gt;. In a &lt;unk&gt; poll for the Channel &lt;unk&gt; programme &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt;s Greatest Hits &lt;unk&gt;, the song was voted &lt;unk&gt;th out of &lt;unk&gt;, and also came in as an &lt;unk&gt; overwhelming number one &lt;unk&gt; favourite among those under the age of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Marketing tie &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ins &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; MGM and &lt;unk&gt; Productions granted Mattel the license to sell a line of Barbie dolls based around the franchise. Mattel announced that the Bond &lt;unk&gt; will be at her &lt;unk&gt; stylish best &lt;unk&gt;, clad in evening dress and red &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; created the dress, which is &lt;unk&gt; to the thigh to reveal a telephone &lt;unk&gt; to Barbie &lt;unk&gt;s leg. The doll was sold in a gift set, with Barbie &lt;unk&gt;s boyfriend Ken posing as Bond in a &lt;unk&gt; designed by the Italian fashion house &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; also collaborated with the makers of Die Another Day to create a cosmetics line based around the character &lt;unk&gt;inx. The limited edition &lt;unk&gt; Colour Collection was launched on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; to coincide with the film &lt;unk&gt;s release. The product names were loaded with puns and &lt;unk&gt;, with shades and textures ranging from the &lt;unk&gt; warm &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; cool and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release and reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day had its world premiere on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt; at the Royal Albert Hall in London. &lt;unk&gt;ueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, making it the second Bond film premiere to be attended by the &lt;unk&gt;ueen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in &lt;unk&gt;. The Royal Albert Hall had a make &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were donated to the Cinema and Television &lt;unk&gt; Fund of which the &lt;unk&gt;ueen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. Die Another Day was the highest grossing &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond film until the release of Casino &lt;unk&gt;. It earned &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest grossing film of &lt;unk&gt;. Die Another Day became a controversial subject in eastern Asia. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hungry. The South Koreans boycotted &lt;unk&gt; theatres where it was released on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a &lt;unk&gt; scene near a statue of the Buddha. The &lt;unk&gt; Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics &lt;unk&gt;. The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was &lt;unk&gt; the wrong film at the wrong time. &lt;unk&gt; The amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism, specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC, Time and Reuters who all used the pun &lt;unk&gt; Buy Another Day &lt;unk&gt;. Reportedly &lt;unk&gt; companies, paying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, had their products featured in the film, a record at the time, although &lt;unk&gt;SA Today reported that number to be as high as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. By choice, the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next Bond film Casino &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Rotten Tomatoes listed Die Another Day with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating. Metacritic gave the film a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; rating, representing &lt;unk&gt; mixed or average reviews. &lt;unk&gt; Michael &lt;unk&gt; of Film &lt;unk&gt; praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory. &lt;unk&gt; Larry Carroll of &lt;unk&gt; praised Lee &lt;unk&gt; for having &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also &lt;unk&gt; a new &lt;unk&gt; to it all. &lt;unk&gt; Entertainment Weekly magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a true filmmaker &lt;unk&gt;, has re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; established the series &lt;unk&gt; pop &lt;unk&gt;. Dana Stevens of The New York Times called the film the best of the &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond series since The Spy Who Loved Me. Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks &lt;unk&gt; stated in his review that the &lt;unk&gt; first half of Die Another Day is classic Bond &lt;unk&gt;, but that &lt;unk&gt; Things start to go &lt;unk&gt; when the ice palace gets introduced. &lt;unk&gt; However, Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on &lt;unk&gt; and special effects, with the plot being neglected. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; This is a train wreck of an action film &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; attempt by the filmmakers to force &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; feed &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond into the mindless &lt;unk&gt; mold and throw &lt;unk&gt; years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Of the action sequences, he said, &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and &lt;unk&gt; bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with &lt;unk&gt; production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as &lt;unk&gt; the seemingly non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string. &lt;unk&gt; Roger Moore remarked, &lt;unk&gt; I thought it just went too far &lt;unk&gt; and that ’ s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; current official &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal &lt;unk&gt; and Robert Wade. Fan reaction to it was above average. After its publication Benson retired as the official &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent &lt;unk&gt;s adventures as a teenager, by Charlie &lt;unk&gt;, was launched in &lt;unk&gt;. As the &lt;unk&gt; was published after Benson &lt;unk&gt;s final original &lt;unk&gt; novel, The Man with the Red &lt;unk&gt;, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; to mark the &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary of Fleming &lt;unk&gt;s birth. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arose in &lt;unk&gt; of a spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off film concentrating on &lt;unk&gt;inx, which was scheduled for a November &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a &lt;unk&gt; winter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alternative to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Bond &lt;unk&gt;. In the late &lt;unk&gt;s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off film based on Michelle Yeoh &lt;unk&gt;s character, &lt;unk&gt; Lin, in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Tomorrow Never Dies. However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ariety reported that MGM had completely pulled the &lt;unk&gt; on this project, to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of &lt;unk&gt; Entertainment, who were reported to be &lt;unk&gt; clearly furious &lt;unk&gt; about the decision. MGM were keen to instead move on with the next film, Casino &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( born May &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a Welsh actress, best known for her role as &lt;unk&gt; Tyson in the BBC medical drama &lt;unk&gt; City.

She appeared in &lt;unk&gt; City from its eighth to eleventh series, from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt; starred in the &lt;unk&gt; musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. &lt;unk&gt; is an advocate of increased ethnic representation in the entertainment industry, and in &lt;unk&gt; founded her own production company, producing the short film &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; for the Cannes film festival in order to further her campaign. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was shortlisted for the &lt;unk&gt; Female Performance in T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; award in the Screen Nation Awards, receiving Honourable Mention in the same category in &lt;unk&gt;, and a further shortlisted nomination in &lt;unk&gt;. She is married to fellow actor Adam &lt;unk&gt;, with whom she has two daughters. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was born in Cardiff, Wales in May &lt;unk&gt;, to a Sierra &lt;unk&gt; mother and a &lt;unk&gt; father. She was raised by her mother &lt;unk&gt;s cousin and his wife in Ely, Cardiff. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s heritage means she is &lt;unk&gt; by descent, although she does not speak the language. &lt;unk&gt; studied at Windsor Clive Primary and &lt;unk&gt; Ely High School, and was a member of the &lt;unk&gt; Youth Theatre, South Glamorgan Youth Theatre, South Glamorgan Youth Choir and the National Youth Theatre of Wales. She left high school before sitting her A Levels in order to pursue her ambition of becoming an actress. She explains : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve always wanted to act. I decided at &lt;unk&gt; I wanted to make my living acting, but even if I couldn &lt;unk&gt;t, I ’ d be in an amateur theatre company. &lt;unk&gt; She then went on to attend the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, studying for a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year acting &lt;unk&gt;. Her first acting role was for the Welsh &lt;unk&gt; when still at primary school, playing a lady &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; waiting at the court of King Arthur. &lt;unk&gt; has stated that it was &lt;unk&gt; Streisand &lt;unk&gt;s performance in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;! that inspired her to act as a child, though credits her adoptive mother with encouraging her to act professionally. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first job was selling &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; Road Market in Cardiff. She worked as a &lt;unk&gt; whilst attending drama school, and, six weeks prior to graduation, was offered a job with the &lt;unk&gt; Made in Wales &lt;unk&gt; theatre company which enabled her to obtain her union card. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; began her career in the theatre, performing in a number of Shakespearean plays including Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night &lt;unk&gt;s Dream, The Tempest, The &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;enice and Macbeth. She states of this : &lt;unk&gt; Shakespeare keeps coming my way. I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I &lt;unk&gt;ll ever be &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and &lt;unk&gt;iola. She explains : &lt;unk&gt; The role of &lt;unk&gt;iola didn &lt;unk&gt;t sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense. &lt;unk&gt; She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ueen of &lt;unk&gt; at the Globe Theatre in London in &lt;unk&gt;, which she described as &lt;unk&gt; a dream of a part &lt;unk&gt;. She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first film appearance was in the &lt;unk&gt; film Great &lt;unk&gt; in Aviation, written by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in which she starred alongside &lt;unk&gt;onathan Pryce and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hurt. &lt;unk&gt;ariety magazine &lt;unk&gt;s David &lt;unk&gt; said of her performance : &lt;unk&gt; In the film &lt;unk&gt;s most &lt;unk&gt; turn, &lt;unk&gt; is a constant pleasure to watch. &lt;unk&gt; and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the &lt;unk&gt; fireworks momentarily back down to Earth. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; recalls having been &lt;unk&gt; at the prospect of working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a &lt;unk&gt; wonderful experience &lt;unk&gt;. Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret &lt;unk&gt; of Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, filmed in Morocco whilst &lt;unk&gt; was pregnant with her first child, starring &lt;unk&gt; Cruz. &lt;unk&gt; says of her film career : &lt;unk&gt; I really like doing film &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first prolific television role was in the IT&lt;unk&gt; drama Soldier Soldier, in which she starred throughout its third series in &lt;unk&gt; as soldier &lt;unk&gt;s wife Bernie Roberts. &lt;unk&gt; credits her chemistry with co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; star &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who played her on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen husband Luke Roberts, for winning her her audition. She went on to appear in Gone With the Wind sequel Scarlett, and star in Welsh soap opera Tiger Bay. She has spoken critically of the way the BBC treated the soap, moving it around the schedules and declining to commission a second series. She acted alongside Pauline &lt;unk&gt; in both &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Being April, deeming &lt;unk&gt; to be a &lt;unk&gt; fantastic &lt;unk&gt; actress, and one she would work alongside again &lt;unk&gt; like a shot &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; appeared at the National Theatre in Helen &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s adaptation of Leo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s War and Peace. In &lt;unk&gt;, she became a presenter of the BBC Wales arts programme Double Yellow, alongside poet Owen &lt;unk&gt; and performance artist Mark Rees. She posed nude but for a pair of yellow rubber gloves to promote the show &lt;unk&gt;s launch, and was highly critical of the BBC when the show was cancelled midway through its second series. She has since concluded that &lt;unk&gt; the kind of audience they would like to bring in with shows like Double Yellow aren &lt;unk&gt;t really into watching T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but at the time was outspoken against the show &lt;unk&gt;s cancellation, stating : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s other notable television appearances include the BBC psychological thriller Green &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Eyed Monster ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, soap opera &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Waking the Dead ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, London &lt;unk&gt;s Burning ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Murder in Mind ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Canterbury Tales ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Sea of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, she starred in the Doctor Who episode &lt;unk&gt; Midnight &lt;unk&gt;, playing an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alongside David Tennant &lt;unk&gt;s Tenth Doctor. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; starred in the &lt;unk&gt; musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated : &lt;unk&gt; The script made me laugh out loud when I read it. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I also like the fact that there were a lot of politically &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; correct boxes being &lt;unk&gt;, but the writers and producer haven &lt;unk&gt;t been restrained by that. &lt;unk&gt; So, instead of &lt;unk&gt; to this altar, they &lt;unk&gt;ve said, &lt;unk&gt; Okay, we have this family that &lt;unk&gt;s half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; black, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American, half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who &lt;unk&gt;s mixed &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; raced and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but we &lt;unk&gt;re not going to be restrained by any of that. We &lt;unk&gt;re not going to &lt;unk&gt; around Martha &lt;unk&gt;s disability or anything. &lt;unk&gt; I liked that. It wasn &lt;unk&gt;t some sort of &lt;unk&gt; hands &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; off approach to what we &lt;unk&gt;re presenting. &lt;unk&gt; She has also been cast in the film &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; starred in BBC medical drama &lt;unk&gt; City as nurse &lt;unk&gt; Tyson. She had previously appeared in &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt;s sister show &lt;unk&gt;, and had made an appearance in &lt;unk&gt; City &lt;unk&gt;s fifth series as patient &lt;unk&gt; Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director &lt;unk&gt;ulie &lt;unk&gt;. After a series of three meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of &lt;unk&gt;, despite being &lt;unk&gt; nervous about signing such a long contract &lt;unk&gt;, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve been someone who &lt;unk&gt;s loved the uncertainty of acting. I &lt;unk&gt;ve loved that one month it &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; in Morocco and the next I &lt;unk&gt;m doing a stage play, then it &lt;unk&gt;s a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; part &lt;unk&gt; thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I &lt;unk&gt;m going to be a working mum I &lt;unk&gt;d rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then &lt;unk&gt; came along, so I &lt;unk&gt;m very grateful &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; signed a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year contract to play &lt;unk&gt;, and described herself as &lt;unk&gt; very similar &lt;unk&gt; to her character, speaking positively about her working relationship with co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stars &lt;unk&gt;aye &lt;unk&gt; and Sharon D. Clarke, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; dream &lt;unk&gt; storylines her character was given. She said of the show : &lt;unk&gt; I really love &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;m surprised how much. What thrills me about &lt;unk&gt; is that you get back what you put in. The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it &lt;unk&gt;s about more than turning up and saying the lines. It &lt;unk&gt;s about understanding it and trying to make it better. That &lt;unk&gt;s actually a lot of fun. What &lt;unk&gt;s great is nobody says, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ust shut up. &lt;unk&gt; They want you to work at it. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, &lt;unk&gt; do I want to do something else? &lt;unk&gt; but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘ &lt;unk&gt; ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work. &lt;unk&gt; In October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; announced that she would be departing from &lt;unk&gt; City in order to have a second child, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve had a great time and I &lt;unk&gt;ll miss it. I made the decision purely because I was pregnant, but I wasn &lt;unk&gt;t really ready to put down the character of &lt;unk&gt;. I &lt;unk&gt;m very sorry to have to let her go. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race and charity work &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Throughout her career, &lt;unk&gt; has been outspoken on the subject of racial discrimination in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states : &lt;unk&gt; I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining ; &lt;unk&gt; If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; They are not being sold as a reason to watch. &lt;unk&gt; She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating : &lt;unk&gt; I could not have played any of the roles I have played on T&lt;unk&gt; if I was white &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it &lt;unk&gt;s still very low and expectations are still very low &lt;unk&gt;. She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that : &lt;unk&gt; I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they &lt;unk&gt;re never Welsh. &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called &lt;unk&gt; Park or &lt;unk&gt; Close I wouldn &lt;unk&gt;t have been in it &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; founded a production company and directed a short film entitled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with &lt;unk&gt; stating : &lt;unk&gt; it just made me decide that if there &lt;unk&gt;s anything I don &lt;unk&gt;t want to do, it &lt;unk&gt;s produce films, because I &lt;unk&gt;m rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end. &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; offered her support to the Action for Southern Africa campaign &lt;unk&gt;! Period, aiming to provide affordable &lt;unk&gt; protection to &lt;unk&gt; women. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was nominated and shortlisted for the &lt;unk&gt; Female Performance in T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; award in the &lt;unk&gt; Screen Nation Awards, for her role as &lt;unk&gt; Tyson in &lt;unk&gt; City. She received Honourable Mention for the same role the following year, and was shortlisted again in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; voted &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; woman in Wales, saying of her : &lt;unk&gt; One of our favourite &lt;unk&gt;, she &lt;unk&gt;s black, beautiful and the term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mummy &lt;unk&gt; should have been made for her. &lt;unk&gt; She placed &lt;unk&gt;th in &lt;unk&gt;, with the Western Mail noting : &lt;unk&gt; the last &lt;unk&gt; years have only seen &lt;unk&gt; become more beautiful and more successful &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; placed &lt;unk&gt;th in the awards in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Personal life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; describes herself as &lt;unk&gt; optimistic, cynical, lazy, naive &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; honest &lt;unk&gt;. She spends her free time &lt;unk&gt; watching television, the theatre, cinema, concerts, indoor wall climbing &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; keeping fit &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; aerobics &lt;unk&gt;. She has a collection of &lt;unk&gt; dolls which she keeps under her bath. &lt;unk&gt; has an interest in travel, and has visited Peru and Kenya among other destinations. She has expressed a desire to visit Brazil and Argentina, and has &lt;unk&gt; a romantic notion of travelling around Europe in a &lt;unk&gt; van &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; often speaks of her pride in her Welsh upbringing, describing herself as &lt;unk&gt; an Ely girl through and through &lt;unk&gt;. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in &lt;unk&gt;. During a &lt;unk&gt; production of Hamlet, &lt;unk&gt; met her future husband, fellow actor Adam &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; son of Love &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; star &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt;. They met again two years later, during a production of Twelfth Night, and went on to become a couple. The pair married in May &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; gave birth to their first daughter in &lt;unk&gt;uly that year. Their second daughter was born in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filmography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has undertaken the following roles from her screen and &lt;unk&gt; debut in &lt;unk&gt;, to the present day. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Film roles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Television roles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge, Battle of Raiders Ridge, and Battle of the Ridge, was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II between Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army and Allied ( mainly &lt;unk&gt;nited States Marine Corps &lt;unk&gt; ground forces. It took place from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; in the Solomon Islands, and was the second of three separate major &lt;unk&gt;apanese ground offensives during the &lt;unk&gt; Campaign. In the battle, &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines, under the overall command of &lt;unk&gt;.S. Major General Alexander &lt;unk&gt;, repulsed an attack by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade, under the command of &lt;unk&gt;apanese Major General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Marines were defending the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on &lt;unk&gt;, which was captured from the &lt;unk&gt;apanese by the Allies in landings on &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit was sent to &lt;unk&gt; in response to the Allied landings with the mission of &lt;unk&gt; the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island. &lt;unk&gt; the strength of Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the &lt;unk&gt;.S. defenses. The main &lt;unk&gt;apanese assault occurred around &lt;unk&gt; ridge south of Henderson Field, manned by troops from several &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine Corps units, primarily troops from the &lt;unk&gt;st &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute Battalions under &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. &lt;unk&gt;. Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack was ultimately defeated, with heavy losses for the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. Because of the key participation by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit in defending the ridge, the ridge was commonly referred to as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources. After &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese continued to send troops to &lt;unk&gt; for further attempts to retake Henderson Field, affecting &lt;unk&gt;apanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; campaign &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, Allied forces ( primarily &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt; landed on &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the &lt;unk&gt;.S. and Australia. They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; month &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long &lt;unk&gt; campaign. Taking the &lt;unk&gt;apanese by surprise, by nightfall on &lt;unk&gt; August the Allied landing forces had secured &lt;unk&gt; and nearby small islands, as well as an airfield under construction at &lt;unk&gt; Point ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; on the north shore of the island of &lt;unk&gt; east of the present day capital of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; placed his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops of the &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Division on &lt;unk&gt; in a loose perimeter around the &lt;unk&gt; Point area. On &lt;unk&gt; August, the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major &lt;unk&gt; Henderson, a Marine &lt;unk&gt; who had been killed at the Battle of Midway. The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air Force &lt;unk&gt; after the Allied code name for &lt;unk&gt;. In response to the Allied landings on &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Army &lt;unk&gt; a corps &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized command based at Rabaul ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; and under the command of Lieutenant &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the task of retaking &lt;unk&gt; from Allied forces. The &lt;unk&gt;th Army &lt;unk&gt; heavily involved with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese campaign in New Guinea &lt;unk&gt; had only a few units available to send to the southern &lt;unk&gt; area. Of these units, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade &lt;unk&gt; under Major General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was at &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the &lt;unk&gt;th ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment &lt;unk&gt; under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was embarked on transport ships near Guam. The different units began to move toward &lt;unk&gt; immediately ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s regiment &lt;unk&gt; the closest &lt;unk&gt; arrived first. The &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; consisting of about &lt;unk&gt; soldiers &lt;unk&gt; landed from destroyers at &lt;unk&gt; Point ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter, on August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; the strength of Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s First &lt;unk&gt; conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at &lt;unk&gt; Creek on the east side of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter in the early morning hours of August &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault was repulsed with devastating losses for the attackers in what became known as the Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; : all but &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; men of the First &lt;unk&gt; ( including &lt;unk&gt; himself &lt;unk&gt; were killed in the battle. The survivors returned to &lt;unk&gt; Point, notified &lt;unk&gt;th Army headquarters of their defeat in the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul. By &lt;unk&gt; August, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit had reached &lt;unk&gt; and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to &lt;unk&gt;. Because of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the Battle of the Eastern &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese decided not to deliver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops to &lt;unk&gt; by slow transport ship ; instead, the ships carrying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers were sent to Rabaul. From there, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese planned to deliver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men to &lt;unk&gt; by destroyers, staging through a &lt;unk&gt;apanese naval base in the &lt;unk&gt; Islands. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and back in a single night, &lt;unk&gt; their exposure to Allied air attack. However, most of the soldiers &lt;unk&gt; heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, could not be taken to &lt;unk&gt; with them. These high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speed destroyer runs to &lt;unk&gt;, which occurred throughout the campaign, were later called the &lt;unk&gt; Tokyo Express &lt;unk&gt; by Allied forces and &lt;unk&gt; Rat Transportation &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the Allies. However, any &lt;unk&gt;apanese ship remaining within the &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in great danger from air attacks. This &lt;unk&gt; curious tactical situation &lt;unk&gt; held for several months. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; movement &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; August, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops were loaded onto the destroyers &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, designated Destroyer Division &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Because of a shortage of fuel, &lt;unk&gt; could not make the entire round trip to &lt;unk&gt; at high speed in one night, but had to start the trip earlier in the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning at a slower speed which &lt;unk&gt; fuel. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; that day, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. dive bombers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; under the command of Lt. Col. Richard &lt;unk&gt;, flew from Henderson Field and located and attacked &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; north of &lt;unk&gt;, sinking &lt;unk&gt; and heavily damaging &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; took &lt;unk&gt; in tow and the three destroyers returned to the &lt;unk&gt; without completing their mission. The attack on &lt;unk&gt; killed &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers and &lt;unk&gt; crew members. Subsequent &lt;unk&gt; Express &lt;unk&gt; runs were more successful. Between &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; September, various &lt;unk&gt;apanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol boats were able to land almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops at &lt;unk&gt; Point, including all of the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Brigade, one battalion of the &lt;unk&gt; Regiment, and the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s regiment. General &lt;unk&gt;, who landed at &lt;unk&gt; Point on the &lt;unk&gt; August Express run, was placed in command of all the &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops on &lt;unk&gt;. On the night of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, as three of the Express destroyers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; prepared to shell Henderson Field after landing their troops, they detected and sank two &lt;unk&gt;.S. ships in the vicinity, the small, old destroyer transports ( called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;SS Little and Gregory that were used to &lt;unk&gt; Allied troops around the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; area. In spite of the successes of the destroyer runs, &lt;unk&gt; insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to &lt;unk&gt; by slow barges. Therefore, a convoy carrying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops and heavy equipment in &lt;unk&gt; barges, mainly from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt; Infantry Regiment under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the barge convoy, killing about &lt;unk&gt; of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit &lt;unk&gt;s heavy equipment. Most of the remaining &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops were able to land near &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;, west of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter over the next few days. By &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; had &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops at &lt;unk&gt; Point and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. &lt;unk&gt; was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the &lt;unk&gt;th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces. &lt;unk&gt; believed that there were only about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines on &lt;unk&gt;. During this time, &lt;unk&gt; continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. Between &lt;unk&gt; August and &lt;unk&gt; September, he relocated three Marine battalions &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt;st &lt;unk&gt; Battalion, under &lt;unk&gt;.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute Battalion &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. These units added about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s original &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men defending Henderson Field. The &lt;unk&gt;st Parachute battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in August, was placed under &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s command. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prelude &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; set the date for his attack on the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter for &lt;unk&gt; September and began marching his forces west from &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; Point on &lt;unk&gt; September. He &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Army and requested that it carry out air strikes on Henderson Field beginning on &lt;unk&gt; September, and that naval warships be stationed off &lt;unk&gt; Point on September &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; destroy any Americans who attempted to flee from the island. &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; issued his attack plan to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; the enemy in the vicinity of the &lt;unk&gt; Island airfield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plan called for his forces to split into three, approach the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter inland, and launch a surprise night attack. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force would attack the perimeter from the west while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; renamed the &lt;unk&gt; Battalion &lt;unk&gt; would attack from the east. The main attack would be by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Center Body &lt;unk&gt;, numbering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men in three battalions, from the south of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. By &lt;unk&gt; September, most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops had started marching from &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; Point along the coastline. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade &lt;unk&gt;s supply base at &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, native island scouts &lt;unk&gt; directed by British government official and officer in the British Solomon Islands &lt;unk&gt; Defence Force, Martin &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; told the Marines of &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops at &lt;unk&gt;, near the village of &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; launched a raid against the &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops at &lt;unk&gt;. Destroyer transports &lt;unk&gt;SS McKean and &lt;unk&gt; and two patrol boats took &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men to &lt;unk&gt; in two trips. &lt;unk&gt; and his first wave of &lt;unk&gt; troops landed at &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; ( local time &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September. &lt;unk&gt; by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men advanced towards &lt;unk&gt; village but were slowed by &lt;unk&gt;apanese resistance. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force pushed into the village. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese defenders, believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards &lt;unk&gt; Point, retreated into the jungle, leaving behind &lt;unk&gt; dead. Two Marines were killed. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops discovered the supply base for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces, including large &lt;unk&gt; of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a &lt;unk&gt; radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, and returned to the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack. &lt;unk&gt; and Colonel Gerald Thomas, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s operations officer, believed that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack would come at the &lt;unk&gt; Ridge, a narrow, grassy, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd &lt;unk&gt; long, coral ridge ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; parallel to the &lt;unk&gt; River just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural &lt;unk&gt; of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. &lt;unk&gt; and Thomas tried to persuade &lt;unk&gt; to move forces to defend the ridge, but &lt;unk&gt; refused, believing that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced &lt;unk&gt; that the ridge was a good location for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders to &lt;unk&gt; rest &lt;unk&gt; from their actions of the preceding month. On &lt;unk&gt; September, the &lt;unk&gt; men of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt;st Raiders and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Center Body of troops was planning to attack the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter at the ridge, which they called &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; because of its shape. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops left the coast at &lt;unk&gt; Point. &lt;unk&gt; into four columns, they marched into the jungle towards their &lt;unk&gt; attack points south and southeast of the airfield. &lt;unk&gt; of good maps, at least one faulty &lt;unk&gt;, and thick, almost impenetrable jungle caused the &lt;unk&gt;apanese columns to proceed slowly and &lt;unk&gt;, costing a lot of time. At the same time, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops approached the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter from the west. &lt;unk&gt; had some intelligence on the Marine defenses, extracted from a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Army pilot captured on &lt;unk&gt; August. During the day of &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night &lt;unk&gt;s attacks. &lt;unk&gt; wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, but they did not reach their assembly areas until after &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the &lt;unk&gt; battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, &lt;unk&gt; was still confident in his attack plan because a captured &lt;unk&gt;.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. &lt;unk&gt;apanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September, causing a few casualties, including two killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First night &lt;unk&gt;s action &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Americans knew of the approach of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols, but did not know exactly where or when they would attack. The ridge around which &lt;unk&gt; deployed his men consisted of three distinct &lt;unk&gt;. At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill &lt;unk&gt; ( so named because it rose &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above sea level &lt;unk&gt;. Six hundred yards north was Hill &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high &lt;unk&gt;, the dominant feature on the ridge. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was unnamed and about &lt;unk&gt; ft ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high. &lt;unk&gt; placed the five companies from the &lt;unk&gt; battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side, holding positions in depth from Hill &lt;unk&gt; back to Hill &lt;unk&gt;. Two of the five &lt;unk&gt; companies, &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;, held a line between the ridge, a small, swampy &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; River. Machine &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun teams from &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt; Company, the heavy weapons company, were scattered throughout the defenses. &lt;unk&gt; placed his command post on Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese cruiser &lt;unk&gt; and three destroyers shelled the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter for &lt;unk&gt; minutes and illuminated the ridge with a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops began &lt;unk&gt; with Marines around the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;st Battalion &lt;unk&gt; led by Major &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attacked the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; company between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; River, overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit became entangled with troops from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack on the ridge that night. &lt;unk&gt;, who was having trouble locating where he was in relation to the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops &lt;unk&gt; attacks, later complained, &lt;unk&gt; Due to the &lt;unk&gt; jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. In my whole life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless. &lt;unk&gt; Twelve &lt;unk&gt;.S. Marines were killed ; &lt;unk&gt;apanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both &lt;unk&gt; in the west and the &lt;unk&gt; unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn. At first light on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge, forcing any &lt;unk&gt;apanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese suffered several casualties, including two officers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second night &lt;unk&gt;s action on the ridge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese to attack again that night, &lt;unk&gt; directed his troops to improve their defenses on and around the ridge. After a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground on the Marine right flank lost to &lt;unk&gt; the night before, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; his forces. He pulled his front back about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to a line that stretched &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;, starting at the &lt;unk&gt; River and crossing the ridge about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; south of Hill &lt;unk&gt;. Around and behind Hill &lt;unk&gt; he placed five companies. Any &lt;unk&gt;apanese attackers &lt;unk&gt; Hill &lt;unk&gt; would have to advance over &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; of open terrain to close with the Marine positions at Hill &lt;unk&gt;. With only a few hours to prepare, the Marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications. They were low on ammunition, with one or two grenades for each Marine. &lt;unk&gt; ordered a reserve force consisting of the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to move into a position just to the rear of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops. In addition, a battery of four &lt;unk&gt; howitzers from the &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s front line units. Late in the afternoon, &lt;unk&gt; stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying, You men have done a great job, and I have just one more thing to ask of you. &lt;unk&gt; out just one more night. I know we &lt;unk&gt;ve been without sleep a long time. But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here. I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s speech &lt;unk&gt; raised the spirits &lt;unk&gt; of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead. As the sun set on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Marines with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops of his brigade, plus an assortment of light artillery. The night was pitch black, with no moon. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, seven &lt;unk&gt;apanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack began just after nightfall, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion assaulting &lt;unk&gt; Company B on the Marine right flank, just to the west of the ridge. The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nder Marine artillery fire, &lt;unk&gt; reassembled his men and continued his attack. Without &lt;unk&gt; to try to &lt;unk&gt; roll &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit &lt;unk&gt; forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the &lt;unk&gt; River, heading for the airfield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations. Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, they paused to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; themselves &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; rations. &lt;unk&gt; ordered his men to continue the attack. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield, as well as Hill &lt;unk&gt;. In the heavy fighting that followed, &lt;unk&gt; and around &lt;unk&gt; of his men were killed, ending that attack. Meanwhile, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, under Major &lt;unk&gt; Tamura, assembled for their planned assault against Hill &lt;unk&gt; from the jungle south of the ridge. Marine observers spotted Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s preparations and called in artillery fire. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, a barrage from twelve &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; guns hit Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s position. In response, two companies of Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s troops &lt;unk&gt; numbering about &lt;unk&gt; men &lt;unk&gt; charged up Hill &lt;unk&gt; with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades. Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also &lt;unk&gt; Company B, pushing the &lt;unk&gt; off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the &lt;unk&gt;. To protect the exposed &lt;unk&gt; Company B, &lt;unk&gt; immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At the same time, a &lt;unk&gt;apanese company from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. &lt;unk&gt; that their positions were now &lt;unk&gt;, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill &lt;unk&gt;. In the darkness and confusion of the battle, the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized. A few Marines began &lt;unk&gt; that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were attacking with poison gas, &lt;unk&gt; other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks. After arriving behind Hill &lt;unk&gt;, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word &lt;unk&gt; withdraw &lt;unk&gt; to anyone within &lt;unk&gt;. Other Marines began to follow them. &lt;unk&gt;ust at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Major Kenneth D. Bailey from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s staff, and other Marine officers appeared and, with &lt;unk&gt; vivid &lt;unk&gt; language, &lt;unk&gt; the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill &lt;unk&gt;. As the Marines formed into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped line around Hill &lt;unk&gt;, Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill &lt;unk&gt; and up from below the east side of the ridge. &lt;unk&gt;nder the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s men. Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s troops &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regimental &lt;unk&gt; gun to the top of Hill &lt;unk&gt; in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which &lt;unk&gt; could have turned the tide in favor of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese, &lt;unk&gt; however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, &lt;unk&gt; ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill &lt;unk&gt; to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the &lt;unk&gt; swept forward, killing &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill &lt;unk&gt;, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that &lt;unk&gt; for a moment and then &lt;unk&gt; the harder... When one wave was &lt;unk&gt; down - and I mean &lt;unk&gt; down - another followed it into death. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese hit &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s left flank just after the &lt;unk&gt; took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle, machine &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun, mortar, and grenade fire. Marine &lt;unk&gt; mm and &lt;unk&gt; mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking &lt;unk&gt;apanese. A captured &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldier later said that his unit was &lt;unk&gt; annihilated &lt;unk&gt; by the Marine artillery fire, which only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of his company survived. By &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; several more assaults, some of which resulted in hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand fighting, and severe sniper fire from all sides, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men were joined by troops from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment, who helped repulse two more &lt;unk&gt;apanese attacks before dawn. Throughout the night, as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses, &lt;unk&gt; remained standing about &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; behind the Marine firing line on Hill &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; his troops and directing their defensive efforts. Said Marine Captain &lt;unk&gt; Smith, who was in position to observe &lt;unk&gt; for most of the night, &lt;unk&gt; I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together, &lt;unk&gt; did it that night. He stood just behind the front lines &lt;unk&gt; stood, when most of us &lt;unk&gt; the ground. &lt;unk&gt; During the heavy fighting, portions of three &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies, including two from Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s and one from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalions, &lt;unk&gt; the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of &lt;unk&gt; Fighter One &lt;unk&gt;, a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one &lt;unk&gt;apanese company &lt;unk&gt;s advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. When no reinforcements joined them, both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after &lt;unk&gt;. Most of the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night. As the sun rose on &lt;unk&gt; September, pockets of &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge. But with Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion shattered after losing &lt;unk&gt; of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill &lt;unk&gt;, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill &lt;unk&gt;. At first light, three &lt;unk&gt;.S. Army aircraft from the &lt;unk&gt;th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese near Hill &lt;unk&gt; and killed most of them, with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; attacks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; As the battle on the ridge took place, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; units also attacked the Marine defenses on the east and west sides of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. The &lt;unk&gt; battalion &lt;unk&gt; led by Major Takeshi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; attacked the southeastern sector of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter, defended by Marines of the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s attack started around midnight, with one company attacking through Marine artillery fire and engaging in hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand combat with the Marine defenders before being thrown back. &lt;unk&gt; was killed in the attack. After &lt;unk&gt;, the Marines, believing that the rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion was still in the area, sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area in front of the Marine lines ; four &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; tank guns destroyed or disabled three of them. After abandoning their burning tanks, several of the disabled tanks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; and killed by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. One tank &lt;unk&gt; down an embankment into the &lt;unk&gt; River, drowning its crew. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, the remnants of the &lt;unk&gt; battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines, but were repulsed. A final &lt;unk&gt; weak &lt;unk&gt; attack by the &lt;unk&gt; unit on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; September was also defeated. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit of about &lt;unk&gt; men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. At about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, two &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies attacked positions held by the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another &lt;unk&gt;apanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; September. The rest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s units were then ordered to withdraw west to the &lt;unk&gt; River valley to join with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s unit, a &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; march over difficult terrain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s troops began the march on the morning of &lt;unk&gt; September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to &lt;unk&gt; their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s positions at &lt;unk&gt; five days later, only half still carried their weapons. The &lt;unk&gt; battalion &lt;unk&gt;s survivors, attempting to follow &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Center Body forces, became lost, wandered for three weeks in the jungle, and almost &lt;unk&gt; to death before finally reaching &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s camp. In total, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces lost about &lt;unk&gt; killed in the attack, including &lt;unk&gt; in Tamura &lt;unk&gt;s battalion, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force, &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; battalion, and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s battalion. An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the &lt;unk&gt;. On and around the ridge, the Marines counted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese dead, including &lt;unk&gt; on the slopes of Hill &lt;unk&gt;. The Marines suffered &lt;unk&gt; killed between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; sent two companies from the &lt;unk&gt;st Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;st Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to pursue the retreating &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The Marines were ambushed by two &lt;unk&gt;apanese companies acting as rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guards for the withdrawal, and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated. The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by &lt;unk&gt;. By nightfall, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon, killing &lt;unk&gt; Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving. On &lt;unk&gt; September, a patrol from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Raiders encountered stragglers from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed &lt;unk&gt; of them. As the &lt;unk&gt;apanese regrouped west of the &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their &lt;unk&gt; defenses. On &lt;unk&gt; September, &lt;unk&gt; moved another battalion, the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, &lt;unk&gt;nd Marine Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, an Allied naval convoy delivered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men from the &lt;unk&gt;rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt;th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. These reinforcements allowed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; beginning on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; to establish an unbroken line of defense around the &lt;unk&gt; perimeter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces &lt;unk&gt; next significant clashes with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese occurred along the &lt;unk&gt; River from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; September and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; October. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; September, General &lt;unk&gt; at Rabaul learned of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s defeat, the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Army &lt;unk&gt;s first defeat involving a unit of this size in the war. The general &lt;unk&gt; the news to the Imperial General Headquarters in &lt;unk&gt;apan. In an emergency session, the top &lt;unk&gt;apanese army and navy command staffs concluded that, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; might develop into the decisive battle of the war. &lt;unk&gt; The results of the battle began to have a telling strategic impact on &lt;unk&gt;apanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. &lt;unk&gt; realized that, in order to send sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on &lt;unk&gt;, he could no longer support the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese offensive on the &lt;unk&gt; Track in New Guinea. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; of the General Headquarters &lt;unk&gt; ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of their objective of Port Moresby &lt;unk&gt; to withdraw until the &lt;unk&gt; matter was resolved. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese were never able to restart their drive towards Port Moresby ; the defeat at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge contributed not only to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s defeat in the &lt;unk&gt; campaign, but also to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s ultimate defeat throughout the South Pacific. After delivering more forces during the next month the &lt;unk&gt;apanese mounted a major ground offensive on &lt;unk&gt;, led by &lt;unk&gt;, in late October &lt;unk&gt; at the Battle for Henderson Field, but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. &lt;unk&gt; later stated that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded, &lt;unk&gt; we would have been in a pretty bad condition. &lt;unk&gt; Historian Richard B. Frank adds, &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;apanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September &lt;unk&gt;, on a ridge &lt;unk&gt; up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield, best known ever after as Bloody Ridge. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, during the American Revolutionary War. It took place near Charleston, South Carolina, during the first British attempt to capture the city from American rebels. It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston, owing to a more successful British siege in &lt;unk&gt;. The British organized an expedition in early &lt;unk&gt; for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America. &lt;unk&gt; by logistical concerns and bad weather, the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May &lt;unk&gt;. Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations, General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston. Arriving there in early &lt;unk&gt;une, troops were landed on Long Island, near Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island where Colonel William &lt;unk&gt; commanded a partially constructed fort, in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault. General Charles Lee, commanding the southern Continental theater of the war, would provide supervision. The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to &lt;unk&gt;, and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing. The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the &lt;unk&gt; nature of the fort &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; log construction. &lt;unk&gt; fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet, which withdrew after an entire day &lt;unk&gt;s bombardment. The British withdrew their expedition force to New York, and did not return to South Carolina until &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When the American Revolutionary War broke out in &lt;unk&gt;, the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America. The city &lt;unk&gt;s citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament &lt;unk&gt;s attempts to tax them, and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April &lt;unk&gt; Battles of Lexington and Concord. Throughout &lt;unk&gt; and into &lt;unk&gt;, militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, the city &lt;unk&gt;s manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel, and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British operations &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British army forces in North America were primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; bases of operations where they had more control, the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies. Major General Henry Clinton, then in Boston, was to travel to Cape Fear, North Carolina, where he would join with largely Scottish &lt;unk&gt; raised in the North Carolina &lt;unk&gt;, and a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men from Ireland under the command of Major General Charles Cornwallis. The plan was beset by difficulties from the start. The Irish expedition, originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December &lt;unk&gt;, was delayed by logistical difficulties, and its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops did not depart until February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, escorted by &lt;unk&gt; warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker. Clinton left Boston on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; with two companies of light infantry, and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon, New York &lt;unk&gt;s royal governor. Major General Charles Lee, sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York, &lt;unk&gt; arrived there the same day as Clinton. New York was at that time extremely tense ; &lt;unk&gt; forces were beginning to &lt;unk&gt; and evict &lt;unk&gt;, and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions. Despite this, Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south. Lee observed that this was &lt;unk&gt; certainly a &lt;unk&gt; way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited. &lt;unk&gt; This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South. Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March &lt;unk&gt;, expecting to find the European convoy already there. He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina, &lt;unk&gt;osiah Martin and William Campbell, and learned that the recruited Scottish &lt;unk&gt; had been defeated at Moore &lt;unk&gt;s Creek Bridge two weeks earlier. Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia, &lt;unk&gt;ames Wright, who had been arrested, and then escaped to a navy ship. Parker &lt;unk&gt;s fleet had an extremely difficult crossing. &lt;unk&gt; by storms and high seas, the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April &lt;unk&gt;, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May &lt;unk&gt;. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided &lt;unk&gt; properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on &lt;unk&gt; expeditions up and down the coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; American defenses &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt;, recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina &lt;unk&gt;s revolutionary government, organized a defense force under the command of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Colonel William &lt;unk&gt;, a former &lt;unk&gt; and Indian fighter. These forces comprised three infantry regiments, two rifle regiments, and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies, and the total force numbered about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and &lt;unk&gt;irginia ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops &lt;unk&gt;, as well as militia numbering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Charleston and the surrounding &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; saw Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, a sandy &lt;unk&gt; of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; long and a few hundred yards wide, as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from &lt;unk&gt; enemy warships. A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar, a series of submerged &lt;unk&gt; lying about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of the city, and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor. Later it would also have to pass the northern end of &lt;unk&gt;ames Island, where Fort &lt;unk&gt;ohnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city. &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt;nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island in March &lt;unk&gt;, and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor. The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; naval detachment described the site as &lt;unk&gt; an immense pen &lt;unk&gt; feet long, and &lt;unk&gt; feet wide, filled with sand to stop the shot &lt;unk&gt;. The gun platforms were made of &lt;unk&gt; two inches thick and &lt;unk&gt; with wooden spikes. Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; that the fleet had sailed, but that he did not know whether it was sailing for &lt;unk&gt;irginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt; confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy. &lt;unk&gt; He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city &lt;unk&gt;s defenses. He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments &lt;unk&gt; were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and &lt;unk&gt; had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces. Square &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall, with walls made from &lt;unk&gt; logs &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; high and &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; wide. The walls were filled with sand, and rose &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted. A hastily erected palisade of thick &lt;unk&gt; helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls. An assortment of &lt;unk&gt; cannon, ranging from &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders to a few British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders and French &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounders, dotted the front and rear walls. General Lee, when he had seen its unfinished state, had recommended abandoning the fort, calling it a &lt;unk&gt; slaughter pen &lt;unk&gt;. President &lt;unk&gt; refused, and specifically ordered Colonel &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; obey &lt;unk&gt; Lee &lt;unk&gt; in everything, except in leaving Fort Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; that he would replace &lt;unk&gt; ; the battle began the next day before he could do so. Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Point. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British arrival &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May &lt;unk&gt;, and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day. &lt;unk&gt; noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, just a few hundred yards from Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s. By &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five &lt;unk&gt; Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. &lt;unk&gt; believing he would not even need Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort &lt;unk&gt;s guns were knocked out, he would &lt;unk&gt; land &lt;unk&gt; and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose &lt;unk&gt; under the guns &lt;unk&gt; and that they could &lt;unk&gt; keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper &lt;unk&gt;. The British fleet was composed of nine man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war ships : the flagship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Bristol, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Experiment and frigates &lt;unk&gt;, Active, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder, in total mounting nearly &lt;unk&gt; cannon. The army forces in the expedition consisted of the &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;rd, &lt;unk&gt;th, &lt;unk&gt;th, and &lt;unk&gt;th Regiments of Foot, and part of the &lt;unk&gt;th. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms. However, the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag &lt;unk&gt;, and it was not delivered until the next day. That same day, Clinton began landing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops on Long Island. The intent was that these troops would &lt;unk&gt; across the channel ( now known as &lt;unk&gt; Inlet &lt;unk&gt; between Long and Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an &lt;unk&gt; of retreat for the fort &lt;unk&gt;s garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an &lt;unk&gt; at the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, which was manned by more than &lt;unk&gt; men and three small cannons, and began to &lt;unk&gt; a guard post at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan. General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. An attempt to &lt;unk&gt; the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; deep, too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition. He considered using boats to ferry the troops across, but the Americans, with timely advice from General Lee, adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position. As a result, the British and American forces faced each other across the channel, engaging in occasional and largely &lt;unk&gt; cannon fire at long range. Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have &lt;unk&gt; the glory of being defeated alone. &lt;unk&gt; The attack was originally planned for &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On the morning of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel &lt;unk&gt;, commanding the &lt;unk&gt;nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the &lt;unk&gt;th South Carolina Artillery, numbering &lt;unk&gt; men. At around &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; am that morning, a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack. Less than an hour later, nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort. Thunder and Friendship anchored about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; from the fort while Parker took Active, Bristol, Experiment and &lt;unk&gt; to a closer position about &lt;unk&gt; yards ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; from Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island, where they anchored facing broadside to the fort. Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position, and the defenders returned the fire. Although many of Thunder &lt;unk&gt;s shots landed in or near the fort, they had little effect ; according to &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; We had a &lt;unk&gt; in the middle, that swallowed them up instantly, and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort, were immediately buried &lt;unk&gt;. Thunder &lt;unk&gt;s role in the action was also relatively short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort, and the &lt;unk&gt; of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts. Owing to shortage of gunpowder, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire, and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons. They also fired in small &lt;unk&gt;, four cannon at a time. One British observer wrote, &lt;unk&gt; Their fire was surprisingly well served &lt;unk&gt; and it was &lt;unk&gt; slow, but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed. &lt;unk&gt; General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island. &lt;unk&gt; by two &lt;unk&gt; of war, the flotilla of &lt;unk&gt; carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson &lt;unk&gt;s defenses. Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt. Around noon the frigates &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; were sent on a roundabout route, avoiding some &lt;unk&gt;, to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort &lt;unk&gt;s main firing platform and also cover one of the main escape routes from the fort. However, all three ships grounded on an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; became entangled in the process. The British managed to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; remained grounded, having moved too far onto the submerged &lt;unk&gt;. Consequently, none of these ships reached its intended position, a piece of good fortune not lost on Colonel &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Had these three ships effected their purpose, they would have &lt;unk&gt; us in such a manner, as to have driven us from our guns. &lt;unk&gt; At the fort, &lt;unk&gt; ordered his men to concentrate their fire on the two large man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort &lt;unk&gt;s guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his &lt;unk&gt;, leaving his &lt;unk&gt; exposed. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships ; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will go up to the town again. &lt;unk&gt; Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort &lt;unk&gt;s walls with persistent broadside &lt;unk&gt;. This strategy failed due to the &lt;unk&gt; nature of the &lt;unk&gt; wood used in its constructions ; the structure would &lt;unk&gt;, and it absorbed the &lt;unk&gt; rather than &lt;unk&gt;. The exchange continued until around &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range. At one point during the battle, the flag &lt;unk&gt; had designed and raised over the fort was shot down. Sergeant William &lt;unk&gt;asper reportedly ran to the &lt;unk&gt; and raised the flag again, holding it up and &lt;unk&gt; the troops until a flag stand could be provided. He was credited by &lt;unk&gt; with reviving the troops &lt;unk&gt; spirits, and later given &lt;unk&gt; for bravery. A painting of this event ( pictured above &lt;unk&gt; depicts &lt;unk&gt;asper &lt;unk&gt;s actions. &lt;unk&gt; casualties, Parker reported &lt;unk&gt; sailors killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded aboard Bristol, which was hit more than &lt;unk&gt; times with much damage to the hull, yards, and rigging. Experiment was also badly damaged with &lt;unk&gt; sailors killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Active and &lt;unk&gt; reported &lt;unk&gt; casualties each. The Americans reported their casualties at only &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. The following morning, the British, unable to drag the grounded &lt;unk&gt; off the &lt;unk&gt;, set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. &lt;unk&gt; in small boats sailed out to the burning ship, fired some of its cannons at the British ships, took what stores and &lt;unk&gt; they could, and retreated shortly before the ship &lt;unk&gt;s powder magazine exploded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The British did not attempt to take the fort again. Within days of the battle, &lt;unk&gt; learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were &lt;unk&gt; on their transports, and on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by &lt;unk&gt; forces. The British did not return to Charleston until &lt;unk&gt;, when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the South again became a focus of the war in late &lt;unk&gt;, its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort. Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition &lt;unk&gt;s failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort &lt;unk&gt; shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William &lt;unk&gt; for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston. &lt;unk&gt; modified in the years after the battle, it was &lt;unk&gt; by Fort &lt;unk&gt; as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War. In &lt;unk&gt;, to celebrate the centennial, companies from Savannah, Augusta, &lt;unk&gt;, Columbia, New York and Boston were invited to Charleston. The site was turned over to the National Park Service in &lt;unk&gt;, and is now part of Fort &lt;unk&gt; National Monument. A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan &lt;unk&gt;s Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island, overlooking the inlet where General Clinton &lt;unk&gt;s soldiers had hoped to cross. The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement. One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel &lt;unk&gt;. Commissioned by the colonial government, he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner, which was flown at the fort during the battle. Despite being shot down during the siege, it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory &lt;unk&gt;. It came to be known as the &lt;unk&gt; flag or Liberty Flag. When Charleston ( lost to the British in the &lt;unk&gt; siege &lt;unk&gt; was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war, the flag was returned to the city by General &lt;unk&gt; Greene.  &lt;unk&gt; High Five Interchange &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange is one of the first five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level stack interchanges built in Dallas, Texas. Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. &lt;unk&gt;ohnson Freeway ( Interstate &lt;unk&gt;, I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Central Expressway ( &lt;unk&gt;S Highway &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, it replaces an &lt;unk&gt; partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the &lt;unk&gt;s. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million project was started in &lt;unk&gt; and completed in December &lt;unk&gt;. It was designed by the &lt;unk&gt; Corporation and built by &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation. The interchange is considered by Popular &lt;unk&gt; to be one of &lt;unk&gt; The World &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; because of its height ( as high as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story building &lt;unk&gt;, its &lt;unk&gt; permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features. In &lt;unk&gt;, the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as &lt;unk&gt; Public Works &lt;unk&gt; of the Year &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange, north of downtown in Dallas, Texas, is a massive five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level freeway interchange. It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic, the Lyndon B. &lt;unk&gt;ohnson Freeway ( Interstate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Central Expressway ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and is the first five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level stack interchange to be built in the city. It replaces the &lt;unk&gt; three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level, modified cloverleaf interchange built in the &lt;unk&gt;s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways. The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically, backing up traffic. Left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand exits contributed to the congestion. Further, its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other, making local access difficult. &lt;unk&gt; to the celebratory gesture, the &lt;unk&gt; High Five &lt;unk&gt; name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turn movements that tower over the landscape. The interchange is as high as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story building, and includes &lt;unk&gt; bridges spread across five levels ( the &lt;unk&gt; High Five &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; support tiers, and &lt;unk&gt; miles of additional highway. The highest ramps are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above ground. The lanes of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, which are on the bottom level, are &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; below ground level, giving the structure a total height of &lt;unk&gt; feet from bottom to top As part of the project, I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was widened to include four dedicated high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; occupancy vehicle lanes ( &lt;unk&gt; lanes &lt;unk&gt; that are barrier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; separated and &lt;unk&gt;. The roads on the five levels are : Level I : &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, an eight lane highway, four lanes going each way Level II : The junction of the two six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane frontage roads, each having three through lanes in each direction, left &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turn lanes and &lt;unk&gt;, and easy access to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Level III : I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, ten regular lanes, five going each way, and four &lt;unk&gt; lanes ( two going each way &lt;unk&gt; separated by barriers Level I&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; : Direct connection ramps ( two levels &lt;unk&gt;, eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf The interchange, with its decorative &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; concrete elements, along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, can be regarded as an enormous work of public art. The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail, named the &lt;unk&gt; Trail, which runs under all levels of the interchange. The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by &lt;unk&gt;. The interchange is considered by Popular &lt;unk&gt; as one of &lt;unk&gt; The World &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, calling it a &lt;unk&gt; labyrinth of lanes &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; five &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level &lt;unk&gt; of engineering &lt;unk&gt; because of its height, the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing, &lt;unk&gt; interchange that accommodated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas. It was a collaborative project between the &lt;unk&gt;, affected motorists and property owners, and the primary contractor, &lt;unk&gt; Construction. An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible. Reasons for upgrading the interchange, in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion, were to improve air quality, safety, and local access. &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million contract by &lt;unk&gt;, the largest ever by that agency. The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts. For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete &lt;unk&gt;s strength ( the first time &lt;unk&gt; had ever done so &lt;unk&gt;, and contained an early completion bonus, a &lt;unk&gt; scale of up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that &lt;unk&gt; was charged for &lt;unk&gt; lane rentals &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; for time they closed down traffic lanes &lt;unk&gt; fees based on &lt;unk&gt; assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to a high of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and &lt;unk&gt; so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed. Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished. To save time and money, innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; connect roads &lt;unk&gt; to be made of steel, but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction, cast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans. However, &lt;unk&gt; decided to use &lt;unk&gt; concrete segmental bridges, rather than casting the bridge elements in place, and used a unique machine, designed and constructed by Deal &lt;unk&gt; of Italy and costing about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million, to move the pieces into place. During the construction, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million cubic yards of &lt;unk&gt; was used, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square feet of retaining walls were built. Additionally, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet of drilled shafts and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; linear feet of drainage pipe were completed. In addition to the construction of &lt;unk&gt; permanent bridges, six temporary bridges were built, resulting in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million square feet of bridge deck. The project was designed by the &lt;unk&gt; Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction, which had begun in &lt;unk&gt; and was completed in December &lt;unk&gt;, more than &lt;unk&gt; months sooner than planned. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Awards &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the American Public Works Association named the High Five &lt;unk&gt; Public Works Project of the Year &lt;unk&gt; for its massive size, its innovative design, the complexity and &lt;unk&gt; of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community. &lt;unk&gt; as the managing agency, &lt;unk&gt; Construction Corporation as the primary contractor, and &lt;unk&gt; Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Route &lt;unk&gt; in Michigan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S Highway &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a component of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Highway System that connects Everett, Washington, to the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula ( &lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;S state of Michigan, with a separate segment that runs from &lt;unk&gt; Point, New York, to &lt;unk&gt;, Maine. In Michigan, the highway runs through the &lt;unk&gt;P in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system, entering the state at &lt;unk&gt; and ending at St. Ignace ; in between, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin. As one of the major transportation &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;P, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states. Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle &lt;unk&gt;, and other segments are listed as state &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; designated Pure Michigan &lt;unk&gt;. There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that date to the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;s. The highway runs through rural sections of the &lt;unk&gt;P, passing through two national and two state forests in the process. The route of what became &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the &lt;unk&gt;P, and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King &lt;unk&gt;s International Highway auto trails in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. The state later included these trails as part of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when the first state highway &lt;unk&gt; were designated in &lt;unk&gt;. Most of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was redesignated as part of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; when the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway System was created on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Since the &lt;unk&gt;s, several changes have &lt;unk&gt; the highway &lt;unk&gt;s routing through the &lt;unk&gt;P. One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley, Wisconsin, and others pushed an originally inland routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline. With the creation of the Interstate Highway System, part of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate &lt;unk&gt; ( I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, though in the &lt;unk&gt;s, the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; freeway, resulting in today &lt;unk&gt;s basic form. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Route description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to a &lt;unk&gt; regional planning committee report, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is a key highway for Michigan, providing its main western gateway. The roadway plays &lt;unk&gt; an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest &lt;unk&gt;, and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS &lt;unk&gt; for its entire length. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country &lt;unk&gt;s economy, defense, and mobility. Together with M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is part of a pair of primary &lt;unk&gt; that bridge the eastern and western sides of the &lt;unk&gt;P. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of roadway in Michigan is divided into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; western segment and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; eastern segment, interrupted by a section that runs for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; in the state of Wisconsin. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Western segment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley, Wisconsin, and &lt;unk&gt;, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into &lt;unk&gt; County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along &lt;unk&gt; Drive, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown &lt;unk&gt; and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues eastward through &lt;unk&gt;P woodlands to the city of &lt;unk&gt;. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake, meeting M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at a &lt;unk&gt; in town. As the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing &lt;unk&gt;ackson Creek and two branches of the &lt;unk&gt; Isle River. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the &lt;unk&gt; Isle in the community of &lt;unk&gt;. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in &lt;unk&gt; the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT &lt;unk&gt; recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of &lt;unk&gt; vehicles, compared to the overall average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns northerly to run along Lake &lt;unk&gt;. The highway continues parallel to the state line from the &lt;unk&gt; area through the national forest toward &lt;unk&gt;. That unincorporated community is the home of the &lt;unk&gt; High School &lt;unk&gt;, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the &lt;unk&gt; River, to Lake Michigan via the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the &lt;unk&gt; Wilderness, and the Lac &lt;unk&gt; Desert Indian &lt;unk&gt;, which includes the Lac &lt;unk&gt; Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from &lt;unk&gt; around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; intersects Federal Forest Highway &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; near Golden Lake in &lt;unk&gt; Township in the middle of the national forest. The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In town, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; intersects M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River, and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls, the county seat of Iron County. On the west side of town, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; meets &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue. The combined highway turns south onto &lt;unk&gt;th Street and meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s eastern terminus at the intersection between &lt;unk&gt;th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county &lt;unk&gt; at the top of the hill. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of, and parallel to, the &lt;unk&gt; River. The roadway passes Railroad, Kennedy and &lt;unk&gt; lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the &lt;unk&gt; River, crossing into Florence County, Wisconsin for about &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Eastern segment &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enters Michigan where it crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River and subsequently meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; Township north of Iron Mountain and &lt;unk&gt;. The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on &lt;unk&gt; Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine, parallel to a branch line of the &lt;unk&gt; and Lake Superior Railroad ( &lt;unk&gt; Railroad &lt;unk&gt;. The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the &lt;unk&gt; Mine. In downtown Iron Mountain at &lt;unk&gt; Street, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; turns west off &lt;unk&gt; Avenue to run across town to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the &lt;unk&gt; Mall. The highway re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enters &lt;unk&gt; Township where &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; separates to the south to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; enter Wisconsin. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( &lt;unk&gt; Railway &lt;unk&gt;. Both road and rail travel through the community of &lt;unk&gt;, where they pass near the largest paper mill in the &lt;unk&gt;P. The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway, where the highway meets the eastern terminus of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. Then &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; continues east through rural Dickinson County to &lt;unk&gt;ulcan, passing north of &lt;unk&gt; Lake through the &lt;unk&gt; Country State Forest, before crossing the Sturgeon River in &lt;unk&gt; and passing into &lt;unk&gt; County. In &lt;unk&gt; County, the environment takes on a more agricultural character along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The highway passes through the edge of the community of &lt;unk&gt; before entering Powers. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; comes to a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way intersection and turns northeast merging onto &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and &lt;unk&gt; on the south side of the &lt;unk&gt; Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the &lt;unk&gt; Indian Community. Harris is on the &lt;unk&gt; County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to &lt;unk&gt; River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of &lt;unk&gt; River, the highway crosses the community &lt;unk&gt;s namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to four lanes along &lt;unk&gt; Street, which forms the east &lt;unk&gt; west axis of the &lt;unk&gt; street grid. Near downtown, the highway meets M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which runs along the city &lt;unk&gt;s north &lt;unk&gt; south axis, Lincoln Avenue. The &lt;unk&gt; merge and run north, bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor. Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula State &lt;unk&gt;, site of one of the two state &lt;unk&gt; for the state of Michigan, the only state to have twin &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de &lt;unk&gt; Community College. The four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane highway crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de &lt;unk&gt;. The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the state : an average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in &lt;unk&gt;. The road turns inland again, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; passes to the west of downtown Gladstone. The highway through here is an expressway, four lanes divided by a central median and no &lt;unk&gt; access. &lt;unk&gt;nlike a freeway, the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and crosses the &lt;unk&gt; Railroad south of the &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue North, where M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; separates from the &lt;unk&gt;S Highways and turns to the northwest. The expressway continues north parallel to the &lt;unk&gt; Railway, crossing the Days River. Through this area, the trunkline carries a speed limit of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; for car traffic. This is the only road in the &lt;unk&gt;P with a speed limit higher than &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; besides I &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which has a speed limit of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de &lt;unk&gt; before ending at Rapid River. In this location, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; separates to the north, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; returns to an easterly track as a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lane road, crossing the Rapid and &lt;unk&gt; rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay. As &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; crosses southern Delta County, it passes through the western unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest. Near Garden Corners, the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de &lt;unk&gt;. After the intersection with the northern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County. As the highway approaches Thompson, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; leaves the western unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest. The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to &lt;unk&gt;, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; River. The trunkline turns inland approaching &lt;unk&gt; and then turns north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northeast to Blaney Park. The community there is a former logging town &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; turned &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; resort at the southern terminus of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; the resort was active from the late &lt;unk&gt;s but declined by the &lt;unk&gt;s. From Blaney Park, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City. Where it intersects a former routing, the main highway crosses the &lt;unk&gt; Railway one last time and runs to the south of &lt;unk&gt; to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through &lt;unk&gt;. After passing the community of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; crosses the Cut River Bridge, &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; over the Cut River. The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the &lt;unk&gt; National Forest near &lt;unk&gt;, running between Lake Michigan and &lt;unk&gt; Lake in the process. The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline, passing &lt;unk&gt; Spot near &lt;unk&gt; Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace. The &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; designation ends at the highway &lt;unk&gt;s partial cloverleaf interchange with I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( BL I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Indian trail through auto trails &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and St. Ignace. The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. In the age of the auto trail, the roads that later formed &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; through the &lt;unk&gt;P were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between &lt;unk&gt; and Iron River were completed in late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula Development Bureau ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; named the area &lt;unk&gt; and the highway the &lt;unk&gt; Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to &lt;unk&gt;, and to all highways in the area in the early &lt;unk&gt;s ; the name was phased out by the &lt;unk&gt; completely in &lt;unk&gt;. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former &lt;unk&gt;S president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in &lt;unk&gt;. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the &lt;unk&gt;P, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin. The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt;. A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle &lt;unk&gt; by seventy years, the route followed &lt;unk&gt; a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay... &lt;unk&gt; This route followed the modern &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt;, using the modern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to stay in Michigan. &lt;unk&gt; of the route followed &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between Powers and &lt;unk&gt;. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. One Canadian auto trail was routed through the &lt;unk&gt;P as well. In &lt;unk&gt;, the King &lt;unk&gt;s International Highway linked &lt;unk&gt;ancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. &lt;unk&gt; had to ship their cars by boat between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie, Ontario, and Thunder Bay or enter the &lt;unk&gt;nited States to continue along the auto trail. The &lt;unk&gt; varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; through the &lt;unk&gt;P from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in &lt;unk&gt; ; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Canada Highway name. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; State trunkline &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a designation that was in use by &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert &lt;unk&gt; near what is now &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; near Iron River in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( Grand River Avenue &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; south of &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt;S Highway System was created on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; partially replaced M &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Crystal Falls to &lt;unk&gt; became a new M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; when the former M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; became &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; ( now &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which is now M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By the next year, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was added along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; as part of a larger extension. The first changes to the routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; itself were made in &lt;unk&gt; with a bypass of downtown &lt;unk&gt;. A larger &lt;unk&gt; was completed in &lt;unk&gt; between Rogers Park and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to &lt;unk&gt; and north to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie ; the former routing was given the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to a new bridge over the &lt;unk&gt; River between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Downtown &lt;unk&gt; was bypassed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the former route was initially designated M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD &lt;unk&gt; changed the &lt;unk&gt; and designations of the highways around &lt;unk&gt;, Thompson and &lt;unk&gt; in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s. The agency rerouted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was redesignated as an extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Thompson, and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was replaced by a further extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The last change was to route &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The MSHD started construction in &lt;unk&gt; on a new road that rerouted &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into St. Ignace for the first time. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; previously followed Worth Road inland to the &lt;unk&gt; Trail to meet the northern extension of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into the &lt;unk&gt;pper Peninsula. The new routing took &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; along the &lt;unk&gt; into St. Ignace. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was routed through St. Ignace along the former &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Further changes in the early &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; the roadway out near &lt;unk&gt; and Crystal Falls. Additional &lt;unk&gt; were completed by the MSHD to move &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to its modern &lt;unk&gt; routing between Gould City and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to &lt;unk&gt; and then along the lake to &lt;unk&gt;. The former route through &lt;unk&gt; was turned back to local control as far east as &lt;unk&gt;. From there east, it was numbered just M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, removing &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; from a concurrency. Another former section into &lt;unk&gt; was added to extend M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The new highway was &lt;unk&gt; around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in &lt;unk&gt; after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II. The western end of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; took on two changes in the &lt;unk&gt;s. M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was extended along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to the state line at &lt;unk&gt; from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension was made from M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s eastern terminus to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie in &lt;unk&gt;. The M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation was renumbered as Business &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. The eastern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; extension was reversed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interstate era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to a freeway between St. Ignace and &lt;unk&gt; St. Marie. In planning maps from &lt;unk&gt;, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the &lt;unk&gt;. It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at &lt;unk&gt;rban Areas &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;, or Yellow Book after the cover color, that was released in &lt;unk&gt; as the federal government &lt;unk&gt; plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in &lt;unk&gt; was Interstate &lt;unk&gt; ( I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The first section of freeway was built in late &lt;unk&gt; or early &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; north of St. Ignace. The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to the bridge. In &lt;unk&gt;, another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sections. At the time, the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; on the bridge, and &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; was shifted to follow I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; along the freeways in the St. Ignace area. The former routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. More sections of freeway were opened in &lt;unk&gt; immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie as well as between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The last two sections opened in &lt;unk&gt; connected the northern end of the freeway at M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, and the section between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. At this time, all of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Department of State Highways expanded &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in &lt;unk&gt;. The state built a new bridge over the &lt;unk&gt; River in &lt;unk&gt;, bypassing downtown. MDOT disposed of the former routing of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; into downtown in two ways. The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control. An extension of M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced the remainder, including the &lt;unk&gt; Bridge, through downtown. In that same year, the department truncated &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; freeway. The last changes were made to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s routing through Iron River in &lt;unk&gt;, bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town. In &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;, although the speed limit for trucks remains &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Memorial designations and tourist routes &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the State Administrative Board named M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the predecessor to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Michigan, the &lt;unk&gt; Highway to honor Frank P. &lt;unk&gt;, a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, the residents of &lt;unk&gt; created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane. The project consisted of &lt;unk&gt; and maple trees planted along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; west of town. The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; Women &lt;unk&gt;s Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, trees and shrubs as a &lt;unk&gt; parkway along &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;. Most of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, along with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in the Lower Peninsula, was designated the &lt;unk&gt;nited Spanish War &lt;unk&gt;eterans Memorial Highway in &lt;unk&gt;. To connect the gap in the routing where &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; cuts through Wisconsin, M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were used in place of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls. Signs marking the highway were not erected until &lt;unk&gt; when Governor George W. Romney had them installed. The &lt;unk&gt; Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; between the northern &lt;unk&gt; city limits and County Road &lt;unk&gt; ( CR &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Delta County. The American &lt;unk&gt;eterans ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation, which was assigned under Public Act &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Two sections of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near &lt;unk&gt; to the M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the segment from the southern M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; junction in &lt;unk&gt; to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These two tours were created in May &lt;unk&gt; through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario. The section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail. This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the &lt;unk&gt; rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging. &lt;unk&gt; On August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT announced that the section of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that runs concurrently with M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Delta County was being included in the &lt;unk&gt;P &lt;unk&gt; Coast Recreational Heritage Trail. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Historic bridges &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are six bridges along current or former sections of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan &lt;unk&gt;s Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A third bridge added to the &lt;unk&gt; in late &lt;unk&gt; has not been added to MDOT &lt;unk&gt;s listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to &lt;unk&gt;, is a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. &lt;unk&gt;. The structure was listed on the &lt;unk&gt; on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the National Park Service approved the listing of the &lt;unk&gt;pper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the &lt;unk&gt; River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; span, pin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; connected, &lt;unk&gt;, through &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( equivalent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the &lt;unk&gt;s, the &lt;unk&gt;pper Twin Falls Bridge carried &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; across the &lt;unk&gt; River. In &lt;unk&gt;, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September &lt;unk&gt;, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in &lt;unk&gt; Township, Dickinson County. As of October &lt;unk&gt;, even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced, MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list. It was built in &lt;unk&gt;. Before &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; used a different routing through &lt;unk&gt; and crossed the &lt;unk&gt; River on what is nicknamed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bridge &lt;unk&gt;. Built as a part of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the river, the water level is actually higher than the road surface. This produces a &lt;unk&gt; effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Paper Company was organized in &lt;unk&gt; and needed a dam on the &lt;unk&gt; River to supply their mill. This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded, and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction. Instead of expensive &lt;unk&gt;, a concrete tank was built &lt;unk&gt; in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made banks higher than the natural banks. The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having &lt;unk&gt; concrete bulkheads, formed by the side spans of the bridge, &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Tourism Council stated : &lt;unk&gt; At one time, the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was &lt;unk&gt; forced under it, &lt;unk&gt; and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley &lt;unk&gt;s Believe It or Not!. The eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; span structure is &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; long. The Cut River Bridge carries &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; across the Cut River in &lt;unk&gt; Township, Mackinac County. This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; induced steel shortages. The span uses &lt;unk&gt; short tons ( &lt;unk&gt; long tons ; &lt;unk&gt; t &lt;unk&gt; of structural steel to bridge the &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; over the river and its &lt;unk&gt; at a height of &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; above the river. The Cut River Bridge is one of only two &lt;unk&gt; deck &lt;unk&gt; bridges in the state. On either side of the bridge, there are picnic areas and trails down to the river. Listed on the &lt;unk&gt; on December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Mackinac Trail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; River Bridge carries H &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the modern successor to &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;, over the &lt;unk&gt; River north of St. Ignace. The bridge is another &lt;unk&gt; arch structure &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; in length and built in &lt;unk&gt;. Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to &lt;unk&gt; widen its deck by five feet &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; and install new &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; along with the addition of decorative retaining walls. The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; is the structure carrying &lt;unk&gt; Street ( BS I &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; over the Power Canal in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marie. Built in &lt;unk&gt;, it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wide ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; long ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; structure is described by MDOT as &lt;unk&gt; massive &lt;unk&gt; with an &lt;unk&gt; innovative &lt;unk&gt; construction method : the previous structure was used as a &lt;unk&gt; for the current bridge before removal. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Major intersections &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; MDOT has erected &lt;unk&gt; along the two Michigan segments of the highway that use the total &lt;unk&gt; starting at the state line in &lt;unk&gt; ; the signs on the eastern segment reflect the &lt;unk&gt; in Florence County, Wisconsin. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Business route &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Business &lt;unk&gt;.S. Highway &lt;unk&gt; ( Bus. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; business route that runs from the Wisconsin state line at the Montreal River. The route extends through downtown &lt;unk&gt; on Silver and Aurora streets before turning northward along Suffolk Street. Bus. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; stays on Suffolk Street for a short while until it turns onto Frederick Street. On Frederick Street, Bus. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; bears north through a residential area along Douglas Street. The eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; at the corner of &lt;unk&gt; Drive and Douglas Street north of downtown. The business route was created in August &lt;unk&gt; when former M &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; was renumbered as a business loop of &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt;. It was originally a bi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; state business connection before the Wisconsin Department of Transportation decommissioned Bus. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in Hurley westward along State Trunk Highway &lt;unk&gt; and northward along &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Raid on Manila ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Raid on Manila of &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; was a Royal Navy false flag military operation during the French Revolutionary Wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of Manila, capital of the Spanish Philippines, capture a Manila galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squadron maintained in the port. Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in &lt;unk&gt;. Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet, an annual convoy of East &lt;unk&gt; merchant ships from &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;ing Dynasty China to Britain, which was of vital economic importance to Britain. So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during &lt;unk&gt;, but had been called off following the Treaty of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore. To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at &lt;unk&gt; in the winter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the British commander in the East Indies, Rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Admiral Peter &lt;unk&gt;, sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS &lt;unk&gt; and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke. After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself. He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila, which would make a valuable prize. &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox, Cooke reached the Spanish capital on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; in Manila Bay, Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive &lt;unk&gt; of Spanish officials aboard, taking them prisoner in turn. Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila, that the treasure ship had been &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations, he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the &lt;unk&gt; River. &lt;unk&gt; the gunboats in a bloodless attack, Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards, unsuccessfully assaulting &lt;unk&gt; before returning to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San &lt;unk&gt;. The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in &lt;unk&gt;, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in &lt;unk&gt;, and the French presence in the region had been confined to &lt;unk&gt;le de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean. Some of the most important trade routes began at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;ing Dynasty China. Early in each year a large convoy known as the &lt;unk&gt; China Fleet &lt;unk&gt;, composed of large East &lt;unk&gt; merchant ships in the employ of the British East India Company, sailed &lt;unk&gt; to Europe from &lt;unk&gt; laden with tea and other commercial cargo. This convoy was economically significant to Britain : one convoy in &lt;unk&gt; was valued at over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million ( the equivalent of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the convoy had been attacked by the French squadron in the East Indies, comprising six frigates commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pierre C&lt;unk&gt;sar Charles de &lt;unk&gt;. In the ensuing &lt;unk&gt; Strait Incident the commander deceived &lt;unk&gt; into believing that the &lt;unk&gt; convoy contained disguised ships of the line and the French admiral retreated, only learning of his error on his return to &lt;unk&gt;le de France. There was considerable concern in India that &lt;unk&gt; might try again in &lt;unk&gt;, or that the Spanish, who maintained a powerful squadron at &lt;unk&gt;, might make an attempt of their own. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s initial impulse on learning in November &lt;unk&gt; of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines, centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in &lt;unk&gt;. Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operating with the Governor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; General of India Sir &lt;unk&gt;ohn Shore and Colonel Arthur &lt;unk&gt; among others, a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages, when unexpected news arrived in India in August &lt;unk&gt; announcing the Treaty of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end. Britain now faced France and Spain alone, while &lt;unk&gt; from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, an old opponent of Britain in Southern India, were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities. The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled, but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and &lt;unk&gt; diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China. A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of &lt;unk&gt; in preparation for the trip to &lt;unk&gt; to load trade goods and join the China Fleet. To escort this force, &lt;unk&gt; provided the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun frigate HMS &lt;unk&gt;, captured from the French at the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun HMS Centurion, which sailed with the convoy in &lt;unk&gt;uly, taking passage through the Straits of &lt;unk&gt;, joined there by the ships of the line HMS &lt;unk&gt; and HMS &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to &lt;unk&gt;. The convoy arrived without incident on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s raids &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reconnaissance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With his convoy safely at anchor in &lt;unk&gt; and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing, Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there. As an added motivation, rumours in &lt;unk&gt; suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive. This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila. &lt;unk&gt; its dollars in the Philippines, the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain. This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies, which operated at an enormous financial loss only &lt;unk&gt; by the substantial subsidy from New Spain. Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies, and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila &lt;unk&gt; since Thomas &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Leaving the heavier warships at &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke sailed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; only with &lt;unk&gt; and Fox, the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard, an experienced linguist. Passing Luzon, Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel, which was lured towards the frigates, which were flying French &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; the Spanish vessel, Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at &lt;unk&gt; and were unfit to sail. Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact, although he did remove &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; silver dollars. The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April &lt;unk&gt; and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s small squadron arrived off Manila. Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels, modelling &lt;unk&gt; on the powerful &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gun Forte and Fox on the smaller &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Late in the afternoon of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping &lt;unk&gt; past the fortress of &lt;unk&gt; and then sailing across the bay on the morning of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, anchoring between Manila and &lt;unk&gt;. From his &lt;unk&gt; point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron dismasted and under repair in &lt;unk&gt;, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and &lt;unk&gt; and the frigates Maria de la &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon, &lt;unk&gt; being &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward &lt;unk&gt; was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack. Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage, and was consequently approached by the &lt;unk&gt;, whose crew came aboard. Malcolm, like Cooke, spoke French &lt;unk&gt; and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new &lt;unk&gt; were Forte and &lt;unk&gt; seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations. The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest. Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox, claiming to be Commodore &lt;unk&gt;, a French officer who, unknown to the Spanish, had been killed in the Action of &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; off Sumatra. The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the &lt;unk&gt;, which had been augmented by fake French uniforms. &lt;unk&gt; the visitor below decks, Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt; the downfall of England &lt;unk&gt;. For an hour the officers drank, Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines, until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to &lt;unk&gt; the French &lt;unk&gt;. This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at &lt;unk&gt;, Rear &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Admiral Don &lt;unk&gt; Mar&lt;unk&gt;a de &lt;unk&gt;, who was not aboard, but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat. Each time, the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at &lt;unk&gt; and taken below decks as prisoners of war. In Malcolm &lt;unk&gt;s cabin, the captured officers were informed of their situation, promised release before the British frigates sailed, and offered more wine. The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and &lt;unk&gt; their clothing. &lt;unk&gt; into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby &lt;unk&gt; River, where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored. Taking the crews by surprise, the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox. These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed, one with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder long gun and two with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pounder long guns, each supplemented by four &lt;unk&gt; guns. The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards, furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned. Malcolm received him with a &lt;unk&gt; of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin, while the boat &lt;unk&gt;s crew were imprisoned below decks. Shortly afterwards, at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and &lt;unk&gt; to the crew, the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately &lt;unk&gt;. Once the meal was finished, Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole, although he retained the captured gunboats. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke led his small squadron past &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary and turned south. Four days later in a storm one of the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again, lost with its twelve crew. The frigates subsequently scouted &lt;unk&gt; before reaching &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary. There Cooke raised Spanish colours in an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but &lt;unk&gt; grounded on a &lt;unk&gt; at the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions of a &lt;unk&gt; sent by the governor of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The captain of the Spanish boat asked the British ships the names of their captains, and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle fire, he put the town on alert. With the defenders &lt;unk&gt;, Cooke abandoned his &lt;unk&gt; and after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the following morning, ordered a bombardment of the fort protecting the harbour. This had little effect, though later the Spanish recovered at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from different &lt;unk&gt;, and Malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing in order to storm the &lt;unk&gt; side of the fort. The boats came under heavy fire, one smashed by a &lt;unk&gt;, killing two and wounding four. Another boat grounded on a &lt;unk&gt; and became stuck ; so with his force in &lt;unk&gt;, as &lt;unk&gt; villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the British from the beach, Malcolm called off the operation. After exchanging shot for an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out of range, with two dead and one wounded on &lt;unk&gt; and eight wounded on Fox, in addition to those lost in the boats. The defenders lost a single man killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. With his frigates now requiring repairs, Cooke withdraw half a league from &lt;unk&gt; and spent three days &lt;unk&gt; the masts and rigging of the ships. Then he sailed north, scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to &lt;unk&gt;. Four days later, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary the squadron halted at a village named &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the north of the Sultanate of &lt;unk&gt; to collect fresh water. On the beach a boat party from &lt;unk&gt; was set upon by &lt;unk&gt; tribesmen. Two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive. Cooke complained to Sultan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the captured sailors were eventually recovered, although not before &lt;unk&gt; and Fox had sailed for China to escort the merchant convoy back to India. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat, although the mission had cost &lt;unk&gt; lives : Admiral &lt;unk&gt; later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty. More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C. &lt;unk&gt; Parkinson suggests that had Cooke &lt;unk&gt;s squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at &lt;unk&gt;. He also notes however that in this scenario &lt;unk&gt; would have been commanding officer, a man with considerably less imagination and &lt;unk&gt; than Cooke. Historian Richard &lt;unk&gt; was critical of the mission, considering the operation to have &lt;unk&gt; no glorious outcome &lt;unk&gt; and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; coming. The &lt;unk&gt; China Fleet sailed without further incident. During the ensuing year Resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion in &lt;unk&gt;uly in the &lt;unk&gt; Strait, and the majority of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s forces were focused on disrupting the French occupation of Suez in the Red Sea. This diversion of British resources created gaps in the coverage in merchant shipping and &lt;unk&gt; was able to send the frigate &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to Manila late in the year to join the repaired Spanish squadron. At the beginning of February &lt;unk&gt;, this combined force sailed to &lt;unk&gt;, taking the British defences by surprise. The British commander Captain William &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advancing on the Franco &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover of darkness that evening in the &lt;unk&gt; Archipelago. The combined squadron then dispersed and the China Fleet was not attacked again until the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, at which a French squadron was again driven off in confusion. The frigates Cooke had mimicked, Forte and &lt;unk&gt; were sent to operate independently against British trade in the Indian Ocean in early &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was captured by HMS &lt;unk&gt; at the Action of &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; near Southern Africa, and Forte was intercepted by HMS &lt;unk&gt; under Cooke on &lt;unk&gt; February near &lt;unk&gt; in Bengal. In the ensuing battle Forte was captured but Cooke mortally wounded, dying on &lt;unk&gt; May.  &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death ( Slayer song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Reign in Blood. The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist, &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; led to the band facing accusations of Nazi &lt;unk&gt; and racism throughout their career. Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood, &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is featured on all of Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s live albums and D&lt;unk&gt;Ds and has appeared in several movies. The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a &lt;unk&gt; classic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Composition and origins &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Slayer guitarist &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman wrote &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; after reading books about Nazi physician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while on tour with the band : &lt;unk&gt; I remember stopping &lt;unk&gt; where I bought two books on &lt;unk&gt;. I thought, &lt;unk&gt; This has gotta be some sick shit. &lt;unk&gt; So when it came time to do the record, that stuff was still in my head &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt;s where the lyrics to &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; came from. &lt;unk&gt; The lyrics detail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins, and included both physical and psychological examinations. Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; are experimental &lt;unk&gt; performed without anesthesia, transfusion of blood between twins, isolation endurance, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with lethal &lt;unk&gt;, sex change operations, the removal of organs and limbs, and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; together, joining heads. &lt;unk&gt;ust a matter of time &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; you rip &lt;unk&gt; apart &lt;unk&gt;, a line from the penultimate verse, is a reference to the allegation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; together twins, one of them deformed ; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to the other child, back to back, their wrists back to back too. &lt;unk&gt; This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor &lt;unk&gt; Alexander at the &lt;unk&gt; trial of SS &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Adolf &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; architect of the Holocaust &lt;unk&gt;, where it was asserted that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the veins together &lt;unk&gt; and turned &lt;unk&gt; them into &lt;unk&gt; twins. &lt;unk&gt; This allegation became more widely known when &lt;unk&gt; Alexander was featured in the &lt;unk&gt; documentary The Search for &lt;unk&gt;, which has been cited by several authors including Gerald &lt;unk&gt;, an expert on &lt;unk&gt;. Towards the end of the song, there is a line &lt;unk&gt; Feeding off the screams of the &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt;s creating &lt;unk&gt;, which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. &lt;unk&gt; was the villain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Controversy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The lyrical content of &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Reign in Blood. The band were signed to Def &lt;unk&gt;am Records whose distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns, deeming the artwork &lt;unk&gt; too graphic &lt;unk&gt;. Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule. &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust, as well as their families and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi &lt;unk&gt; which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman &lt;unk&gt;s interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; his most prized item being a German Knight &lt;unk&gt;s Cross. Hanneman &lt;unk&gt; asserting : &lt;unk&gt; I know why people &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s because they get this knee &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there &lt;unk&gt;s nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me &lt;unk&gt; well, isn &lt;unk&gt;t that obvious? I shouldn &lt;unk&gt;t have to tell you that. &lt;unk&gt; According to guitarist Kerry King : &lt;unk&gt; Yeah, &lt;unk&gt; Slayer are Nazis, fascists, communists &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; all that fun shit. And of course we got the most &lt;unk&gt; for it in Germany. I was always like, &lt;unk&gt; Read the lyrics and tell me what &lt;unk&gt;s offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s preaching fucking World War II? &lt;unk&gt; People get this thought in their heads &lt;unk&gt; especially in Europe &lt;unk&gt; and you &lt;unk&gt;ll never talk them out of it. &lt;unk&gt; The song drew accusations of racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews, and have stated numerous times that they do not &lt;unk&gt; racism and are merely interested in the subject. In &lt;unk&gt;, the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Slayer &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album Christ Illusion drew comparison to &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; deals with the September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, attacks, and tells the story from a terrorist &lt;unk&gt;s perspective. &lt;unk&gt; Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;, although it did not &lt;unk&gt;, in part, he believes, due to peoples &lt;unk&gt; view that the song is &lt;unk&gt; just Slayer being Slayer &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music and structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; is the longest track on the album Reign in Blood, spanning &lt;unk&gt; minutes and &lt;unk&gt; seconds, where the total duration of the album is &lt;unk&gt; minutes. Additionally, it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album, featuring prominent verses and choruses, where most tracks on the album &lt;unk&gt; them. Hanneman and King deliver their &lt;unk&gt; intricate riffs &lt;unk&gt;, which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand, and Araya bursts out his piercing scream, with Lombardo performing beats of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in &lt;unk&gt;, the band hired a full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; made one mistake out of the nine songs the band &lt;unk&gt; him with, on &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;. Before the &lt;unk&gt; big double bass part &lt;unk&gt; there is a lead section, which &lt;unk&gt; could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. &lt;unk&gt; could not tell how many &lt;unk&gt; the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members told him there were eight, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the song afterwards. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; did not enter any charts, it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blood. Clay &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; Magazine noted that the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; of any band playing fast and &lt;unk&gt; or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the &lt;unk&gt; to come, while musically laying the &lt;unk&gt; for the rest of the record : fast, lean and filthy. &lt;unk&gt; Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that &lt;unk&gt; There &lt;unk&gt;s no better song to kick things off than the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt;, one of the most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and &lt;unk&gt;eff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist &lt;unk&gt; vocalist Tom Araya screams and &lt;unk&gt; his tale of Nazi war criminal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the publicity generated by the controversy, the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop &lt;unk&gt;, during the Seasons in the Abyss period. Hanneman placed SS &lt;unk&gt; on his guitar, and wrote &lt;unk&gt; SS &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a song about Reinhard &lt;unk&gt;, the second in command in the &lt;unk&gt; organization. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Appearances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; has appeared in several movies and T&lt;unk&gt; shows including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : The New &lt;unk&gt; in a scene when the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is turning into a spider, &lt;unk&gt; : The Movie during a car stunt, the &lt;unk&gt; Iraq War documentary Soundtrack to War, which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield, and on an episode of The &lt;unk&gt; when &lt;unk&gt; asks a female escort to shoot her. The half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; She Watch Channel Zero?! &lt;unk&gt;, sampled by &lt;unk&gt; in their song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hell &lt;unk&gt;, which appeared in the Breaking Bad episode &lt;unk&gt; Thirty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Eight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and sampled by &lt;unk&gt; on their &lt;unk&gt; single &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and featured in the multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; platform video game Tony Hawk &lt;unk&gt;s Project &lt;unk&gt;. Nolan Nelson, who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is &lt;unk&gt; one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded. Don &lt;unk&gt;t know who Slayer is? I feel sorry for you. &lt;unk&gt; A Slayer tribute band called Dead Skin Mask released an album with eight Slayer tracks, &lt;unk&gt; Angel of Death &lt;unk&gt; being one of them.

It &lt;unk&gt; the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a &lt;unk&gt; street art documentary by graffiti artist &lt;unk&gt; who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Richard &lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt; Tonight The Streets Are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. &lt;unk&gt; Childs of The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club noted in his review of &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; that the &lt;unk&gt; reveal that the art show was a police &lt;unk&gt; gives the show a moment to joke about the anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. &lt;unk&gt; asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in &lt;unk&gt; ’ s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns. &lt;unk&gt; American street artist &lt;unk&gt; guest starred in &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; as himself. The graffiti art featuring Homer &lt;unk&gt;s face and the word &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Barack Obama &lt;unk&gt; Hope &lt;unk&gt; poster and his &lt;unk&gt; Giant image. &lt;unk&gt; has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early &lt;unk&gt;s because of its &lt;unk&gt; blend of humor and social commentary &lt;unk&gt;, and he felt &lt;unk&gt; deeply honored &lt;unk&gt; to be included in an episode. &lt;unk&gt; wrote on his website that &lt;unk&gt; Part of being on The Simpsons, is you ’ re being honored as a reference point in culture. &lt;unk&gt; He described the plot of the episode as &lt;unk&gt; great &lt;unk&gt;, adding that the staff members of the show &lt;unk&gt; were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed ( even though I had to make fun of myself to do so &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; This was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s first acting performance. Street artists English, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; also guest starred in the episode as themselves. The traditional Simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that &lt;unk&gt; the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of &lt;unk&gt;. The Game of &lt;unk&gt; opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional map of the fictional continent &lt;unk&gt;. In the Simpsons opening, these locations were substituted with places in Springfield, and The Wall was replaced with the Simpson family &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The theme song featured in the Game of &lt;unk&gt; opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and used in the Simpsons opening as well. Nicholas &lt;unk&gt;, known for &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; covers of famous songs on YouTube, performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt;. He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.

The episode became the second highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated broadcast in Fox &lt;unk&gt;s Animation &lt;unk&gt; lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; demographic, finishing higher than new episodes of American Dad!, Napoleon &lt;unk&gt;, and The Cleveland Show, but lower than a new Family Guy episode ( which received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating and was seen by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million people &lt;unk&gt;.

Writing for The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club, television reviewer &lt;unk&gt; Childs commented that &lt;unk&gt; Exit Through the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Mart &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; somewhat amusing and far more coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode &lt;unk&gt; a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough. &lt;unk&gt; Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of &lt;unk&gt;. Tim &lt;unk&gt; of T&lt;unk&gt;.com called it &lt;unk&gt; one minute of genius &lt;unk&gt;, and MT&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Brandon &lt;unk&gt; wrote : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this one out of the park. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;enna Busch of &lt;unk&gt; and Kelly West of Cinema &lt;unk&gt;, both fans of Game of &lt;unk&gt;, named the opening the best in the history of the show. IGN &lt;unk&gt;s Eric Goldman commented : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever &lt;unk&gt; loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inspired version of the terrific Game of &lt;unk&gt; credits. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Burma &lt;unk&gt; The first &lt;unk&gt; invasions of Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were a series of military conflicts between &lt;unk&gt; Khan &lt;unk&gt;s Yuan dynasty, division of the &lt;unk&gt; Empire, and the Pagan Empire that took place between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The invasions toppled the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Pagan Empire, and the &lt;unk&gt; army seized Pagan territories in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and northern Burma to &lt;unk&gt;. The invasions &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; years of political fragmentation in Burma and the rise of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia. The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China. When King &lt;unk&gt; refused, Emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan himself sent another mission in &lt;unk&gt;, again demanding tribute. It too was rejected. In &lt;unk&gt;, the emperor ordered the &lt;unk&gt; government to secure the &lt;unk&gt; in order to block an escape path for the Song, and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested. Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the &lt;unk&gt; Army in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After a brief lull, &lt;unk&gt; Khan in &lt;unk&gt; turned his attention to Southeast Asia, demanding tribute from Pagan, the Khmer Empire, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt; king again refused, the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma. Two dry season campaigns ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; later, the Mongols had occupied down to &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, forcing the &lt;unk&gt; king to flee to Lower Burma. The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; negotiations began in &lt;unk&gt;, and ended with &lt;unk&gt; finally agreeing to submit in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the &lt;unk&gt; of the Yuan dynasty or the &lt;unk&gt; Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the &lt;unk&gt; government in exchange for the evacuation of &lt;unk&gt; troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as &lt;unk&gt; was assassinated in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The &lt;unk&gt; command at &lt;unk&gt; now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to &lt;unk&gt;. The Pagan Empire &lt;unk&gt; and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March &lt;unk&gt;, they accepted the voluntary submission of King &lt;unk&gt; of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. But &lt;unk&gt; was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in his &lt;unk&gt;, Il &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; referred to the invaders as the &lt;unk&gt; ( after the central Asian &lt;unk&gt; troops that largely made up the &lt;unk&gt; invasion army &lt;unk&gt; ; today, the term &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; refers to the Han Chinese instead. King &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; remembered in &lt;unk&gt; history as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, ( &lt;unk&gt; the King who &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Pagan and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt;th century, the Pagan Empire, along with the Khmer Empire, was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia. For much of its history, Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom and its predecessor &lt;unk&gt;, both with &lt;unk&gt; as their capital city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times &lt;unk&gt; themselves with the &lt;unk&gt; Empire to their west and at other times with China &lt;unk&gt;s Tang and Song dynasties. Indeed, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself. Between the newly conquered &lt;unk&gt; territory and Pagan were a wide &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; stretching from present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; prefectures in &lt;unk&gt; as well as the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; regions ( presumably in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day northern Shan State &lt;unk&gt;, which Pagan and &lt;unk&gt; had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the &lt;unk&gt; mostly consist of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of high mountain ranges. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; conquest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Empire first arrived at the &lt;unk&gt; of the Pagan Empire in &lt;unk&gt; by invading the &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China. The &lt;unk&gt; armies captured the capital, &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and went on to &lt;unk&gt; much of the kingdom by &lt;unk&gt;. The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the &lt;unk&gt; as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in &lt;unk&gt; circuits of the former &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Decline of Pagan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calm, had been in long and slow decline since the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. The continuous growth of tax &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in South &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the decline continued. On the eve of the &lt;unk&gt; invasions, between one and two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; thirds of &lt;unk&gt;pper Burma &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; land had been donated to religion. The crown &lt;unk&gt;s ability to &lt;unk&gt; defenses was in serious jeopardy. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prelude to war &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; mission ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early &lt;unk&gt;. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan, who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions. In Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s case, he had ordered the &lt;unk&gt; governor of &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; control of the &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute. The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan. At the border, the ruler of the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; regions submitted to the Mongols. When the &lt;unk&gt; envoys led by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King &lt;unk&gt; to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the &lt;unk&gt; envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. &lt;unk&gt; them was a &lt;unk&gt; envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt;s wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious &lt;unk&gt; regions in April &lt;unk&gt;. The rebel leader A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was brought back to Pagan. &lt;unk&gt; relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second &lt;unk&gt; mission ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At Beijing, &lt;unk&gt; Khan, who was preparing an invasion of &lt;unk&gt;apan, decided against a war with Pagan &lt;unk&gt; for the time being. On &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, he sent a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; member delegation led by an imperial ambassador, the First Secretary to the Board &lt;unk&gt;, to Pagan. The delegation carried a letter from the emperor. The letter says : &lt;unk&gt; If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Highest, send one of your brothers or senior ministers, to show men that all the world is linked with &lt;unk&gt;s, and enter into a perpetual alliance. This will add to your reputation, and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war, who will be the victor? &lt;unk&gt; well, O king, Our words. &lt;unk&gt; This time, the &lt;unk&gt; king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. ( The &lt;unk&gt; chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed. But both &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed. &lt;unk&gt; At any rate, the imperial envoys did not get back to &lt;unk&gt; in due time. The newly formed &lt;unk&gt; government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; consolidation of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meanwhile, in &lt;unk&gt;, the former &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Din Omar as governor. In May &lt;unk&gt;, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the &lt;unk&gt; evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. &lt;unk&gt;ust coming off a disastrous &lt;unk&gt;apanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the &lt;unk&gt; provincial army to secure the &lt;unk&gt; in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the &lt;unk&gt; army proceeded to consolidate the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. ( Elsewhere, the main &lt;unk&gt; armies had captured most of the Song territory by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; By &lt;unk&gt;, at least one &lt;unk&gt; vassal state named &lt;unk&gt; Gold &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( modern &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had submitted to the Mongols. Like in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in &lt;unk&gt;, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under &lt;unk&gt; command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking peoples or people from the further west : Turks from &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, but also captive soldiers from the Persian &lt;unk&gt; empire, the &lt;unk&gt;, and even &lt;unk&gt; from the lower &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Border war ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; What followed was a border war in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the &lt;unk&gt; of Marco Polo. Although the &lt;unk&gt; chronicles have no record of the border war, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inscription mentions the army &lt;unk&gt;s defeat at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo &lt;unk&gt;s accounts, a &lt;unk&gt; army &lt;unk&gt; invaded &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; territory of Gold &lt;unk&gt;, and was defeated by the &lt;unk&gt; army in April &lt;unk&gt;. The battle took place either at the &lt;unk&gt; valley ( in present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; km southwest at &lt;unk&gt; ( present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture &lt;unk&gt;, which the &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt;. The Yuan Chronicle reports that only &lt;unk&gt; men defeated a &lt;unk&gt; army of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; horses and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It also reports only one &lt;unk&gt; was killed, in trying to catch an elephant. According to Marco Polo, the &lt;unk&gt; army consisted of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mounted &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on each of which was set a tower of timber, well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; framed and strong, and carrying from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; armed fighting men. &lt;unk&gt; Even then, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; figures of the &lt;unk&gt; army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the side of generosity &lt;unk&gt; not to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; their glory in defeating superior numbers. &lt;unk&gt; According to Marco Polo &lt;unk&gt;s account, in the early stages of the battle, the Turkish and &lt;unk&gt; horsemen &lt;unk&gt; took such &lt;unk&gt; at the sight of the &lt;unk&gt; that they would not be got to face the &lt;unk&gt;, but always &lt;unk&gt; and turned back, &lt;unk&gt; while the &lt;unk&gt; forces pressed on. But the &lt;unk&gt; commander &lt;unk&gt; did not panic ; he ordered his troops to &lt;unk&gt;, and from the cover of the nearby &lt;unk&gt;, aim their bows directly at the advancing &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Raid of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; army pressed on after the monsoon season. In the following dry season of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, c. December &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; army of &lt;unk&gt; led by &lt;unk&gt; al &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Din, son of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advanced to &lt;unk&gt;, which defended the &lt;unk&gt; Pass. They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned &lt;unk&gt;. But they found the heat excessive and returned. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interlude ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Despite the &lt;unk&gt; military success, the control of the &lt;unk&gt; remained contested. Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions, and the &lt;unk&gt;, apparently taking advantage of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere, rebuilt their forts at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; later in &lt;unk&gt;, posting permanent garrisons commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. But their control was short &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lived. The Great Khan &lt;unk&gt;s attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in &lt;unk&gt;. He had had mixed success : his &lt;unk&gt; forces had finished off the last of the Song in &lt;unk&gt; but had again failed to take &lt;unk&gt;apan in &lt;unk&gt;. That year, the &lt;unk&gt; emperor sent another mission to Pagan, demanding tribute yet again. The &lt;unk&gt; king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s court. ( With &lt;unk&gt;, the emperor summoned the king of &lt;unk&gt; himself to Beijing. &lt;unk&gt; At Pagan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit. The &lt;unk&gt; court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma. ( He also ordered an invasion of &lt;unk&gt;, whose king too had refused to submit. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt;s troubles did not go &lt;unk&gt; elsewhere in the kingdom. In the same year, a &lt;unk&gt; named &lt;unk&gt; seized the southern port city of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by killing its Pagan &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; appointed governor. Although the king &lt;unk&gt;s three sons were &lt;unk&gt; of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the king, preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north, did not ( or could not &lt;unk&gt; take any action on &lt;unk&gt;. Throughout &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of &lt;unk&gt; and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not &lt;unk&gt; an attack on Pagan itself. At least one army consisted of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men of the &lt;unk&gt; Persian &lt;unk&gt; Empire under the command of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was sent to &lt;unk&gt; to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central &lt;unk&gt;. On the &lt;unk&gt; side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; army led by generals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was deployed at a fort at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The invasion began on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Prince &lt;unk&gt; was the commander &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; chief of the invasion force ; his deputies were &lt;unk&gt;ice Governor &lt;unk&gt;, and commander &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the &lt;unk&gt; River using over &lt;unk&gt; boats ; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the &lt;unk&gt; fort at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; chronicles report an overwhelming number of &lt;unk&gt; forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. ( The chronicles say that the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men while the &lt;unk&gt; army numbered &lt;unk&gt; million men and &lt;unk&gt; million horses. &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion of northern Burma &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The defeat at &lt;unk&gt; broke the back of &lt;unk&gt; defenses. The &lt;unk&gt; army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. &lt;unk&gt;, the next fort &lt;unk&gt;, fell just six days later on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; sources say that the &lt;unk&gt; lost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men at &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; armies pushed farther south into the &lt;unk&gt; valley. They took the ancient &lt;unk&gt; capital of &lt;unk&gt;, about &lt;unk&gt; km north of Pagan on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing &lt;unk&gt; valley excessive, and evacuated &lt;unk&gt;, allowing the &lt;unk&gt; to return to &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;. But the &lt;unk&gt; army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook &lt;unk&gt;, and defeated another &lt;unk&gt; stand south of &lt;unk&gt;, probably near &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, opening the way to Pagan, about &lt;unk&gt; km south. After the defeat, the king &lt;unk&gt;, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The &lt;unk&gt; forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at &lt;unk&gt;, west of &lt;unk&gt;. Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to &lt;unk&gt; but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was in open revolt. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Peace negotiations ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given his precarious position, &lt;unk&gt; decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols. In November &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the king ordered his generals &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations. The &lt;unk&gt; commanders at &lt;unk&gt;, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; Wade &lt;unk&gt; Giles : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their &lt;unk&gt; demand that the &lt;unk&gt; king send a formal delegation to the emperor. The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire, and central Burma to be organized as the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( Chinese : &lt;unk&gt; ; Wade &lt;unk&gt; Giles : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Chung &lt;unk&gt;. After a long &lt;unk&gt;, the king agreed to submit but wanted the &lt;unk&gt; troops to withdraw. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, he sent an embassy led by Shin &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a learned monk, to the emperor &lt;unk&gt;s court. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Treaty of Beijing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the Yuan emperor. The &lt;unk&gt; delegation formally acknowledged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. ( Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal. &lt;unk&gt; In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops &lt;unk&gt; the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The &lt;unk&gt; embassy arrived back at &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, and reported the terms to the king. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; But the agreement broke down a month later. In late &lt;unk&gt;une, the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;iceroy of &lt;unk&gt;. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not &lt;unk&gt; broke away. No successor to &lt;unk&gt;, who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing, emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intervention ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given the chaos, the governor of &lt;unk&gt; ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The &lt;unk&gt; army commanded by Prince &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sin &lt;unk&gt;, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era &lt;unk&gt; scholarship, the &lt;unk&gt; army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of &lt;unk&gt; men ; occupied the city ; and sent out &lt;unk&gt; to receive homage, one of which reached south of &lt;unk&gt;. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary &lt;unk&gt; of the conquest. Recent research shows that the &lt;unk&gt; forces most probably never reached Pagan. They were held at bay by the &lt;unk&gt; defenses led by commanders &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and probably never got closer than &lt;unk&gt; km north of Pagan. ( An inscription dated &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the &lt;unk&gt; army. &lt;unk&gt; Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. At any rate, the &lt;unk&gt; army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to &lt;unk&gt;. They remained there as the treaty was now void. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete. But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created. They would send no more expeditions to restore order. The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to &lt;unk&gt; the fragmented country. Indeed, his real aim all along may have been &lt;unk&gt; to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented. &lt;unk&gt; It would be another two years until one of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sons, &lt;unk&gt;, emerged as king of Pagan in May &lt;unk&gt;. But the new &lt;unk&gt; king &lt;unk&gt; controlled just a small area around the capital, and had no real army. The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers. The uneasy arrangement would persist until &lt;unk&gt;. The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to &lt;unk&gt; as the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; but ended the fictional central Burma province of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers &lt;unk&gt; consolidating support. To check their rising power, &lt;unk&gt; submitted to the Mongols in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, and was recognized by the Yuan emperor &lt;unk&gt; Khan as King of Pagan on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of &lt;unk&gt;. The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power. On &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the three brothers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and founded the &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom. The &lt;unk&gt; forced the &lt;unk&gt; government to intervene again, leading to the second &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Burma ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The invasion failed. Two years later, on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt;, the Mongols abolished the province of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, evacuated &lt;unk&gt;, and returned to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The war was one of several near simultaneous wars &lt;unk&gt; by the &lt;unk&gt; Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late &lt;unk&gt;th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols, the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions &lt;unk&gt; in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Age of political fragmentation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire. However, the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it. Pagan &lt;unk&gt;s disintegration was &lt;unk&gt; in fact more prolonged and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government, the collapse could have been temporary, and the country “ could have risen again ”. But the dynasty could not recover, and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum, no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath. As a result, several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. It was only in the late &lt;unk&gt;th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the &lt;unk&gt; basin, restoring some semblance of normalcy. The vast region surrounding the &lt;unk&gt; valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states well into the &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rise of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the &lt;unk&gt; invasions was the emergence of Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia. The Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan people who came down with the &lt;unk&gt; invasions stayed. By the early &lt;unk&gt;th century, several Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day &lt;unk&gt; to northern and eastern &lt;unk&gt; to northern and central Thailand and Laos. Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols, who viewed the states as a useful &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and the rest of Southeast Asia. The Mongols, who were still trying to incorporate &lt;unk&gt; into the central administration, were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of &lt;unk&gt; into the fold. ( The integration of &lt;unk&gt; itself into “ China &lt;unk&gt; ” was to take several more centuries, and continues to today. &lt;unk&gt; As such, from the newly formed Tai &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai &lt;unk&gt;iet and &lt;unk&gt; in eastern Southeast Asia, the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute. Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government, they were the native chieftains, “ who would have ruled there in any case, and they did as they pleased. ” &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of China on the &lt;unk&gt; border &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The war also marked the arrival of China at the &lt;unk&gt; of Burma. The old &lt;unk&gt; Kingdom, known to the &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; Raj &lt;unk&gt; was now a &lt;unk&gt; Chinese province. ( The &lt;unk&gt; now called the new powers at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; speaking soldiers of &lt;unk&gt;.

The raids by various Shan states into &lt;unk&gt;pper Burma would continue until the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mongolia &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; relations &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the official visit by the President &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; in November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; San Suu &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; of National League for Democracy, said this was the first ever &lt;unk&gt; mission since the Mongols came &lt;unk&gt; years earlier.  &lt;unk&gt; The Boat Race &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Boat Race took place on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. Held annually, the event is a side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side rowing race between crews from the &lt;unk&gt;niversities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. Oxford won the race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s crew featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history. The race took place in very difficult weather conditions &lt;unk&gt; strong winds and heavy rain &lt;unk&gt; resulting in the slowest winning time in over sixty years. Oxford won by six lengths, the largest margin of victory since the &lt;unk&gt; race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis beat Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie in the reserve race, while Oxford won the Women &lt;unk&gt;s Boat Race. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Boat Race is a side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side rowing competition between the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; Dark Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the &lt;unk&gt; Light Blues &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Oxford by over a length in the previous year &lt;unk&gt;s race and the overall lead, with &lt;unk&gt; victories to Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. The race was sponsored by &lt;unk&gt; for the fourth time. The first Women &lt;unk&gt;s Boat Race took place in &lt;unk&gt;, but did not become an annual fixture until the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt;ntil &lt;unk&gt;, the contest was conducted as part of the &lt;unk&gt; Boat Races, but as of the &lt;unk&gt; race, it is held on the River Thames, on the same day as the men &lt;unk&gt;s main and reserve races. The reserve race, contested between Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis boat and Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie boat has been held since &lt;unk&gt;. It usually takes place on the &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the main Boat Race. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Crews &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s crew weighed an average of &lt;unk&gt; pounds ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; more per rower than their opponents, and featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old American Mike &lt;unk&gt;. Cambridge crew consisted of six Britons, two Australians and an American, while Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s comprised four Americans, three Britons, an Australian and a German. Both &lt;unk&gt;, Nick &lt;unk&gt; and Rebecca &lt;unk&gt;, were former Blues, while Cambridge also saw &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Tom Edwards return, having rowed in &lt;unk&gt;. Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s boat club president Dan O &lt;unk&gt; was the seventh Light Blue president not to row in his own Blue Boat. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford were pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; race favourites, but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. Oxford took an early lead, but the boats closed on each other, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both &lt;unk&gt; in an attempt to prevent a collision. By &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded ; by the time the crews passed under &lt;unk&gt; Bridge they were level. Along &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Oxford moved ahead once again, and were clear of Cambridge after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in &lt;unk&gt; minutes &lt;unk&gt; seconds, six lengths and &lt;unk&gt; seconds ahead of their opponents. Driving rain, strong winds and &lt;unk&gt; water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years, but the largest margin of victory since the &lt;unk&gt; race. Oxford &lt;unk&gt;s Isis beat Cambridge &lt;unk&gt;s Goldie by three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarter lengths in the reserve race.

In the episode, Michael Scott &lt;unk&gt;s ( Steve Carell &lt;unk&gt; replacement appears in the office, to start receiving training from Michael. The new manager, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ickers ( Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, has everyone hoping to make good first impressions : Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms &lt;unk&gt; finds himself &lt;unk&gt; typecast while &lt;unk&gt;im Halpert ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Krasinski &lt;unk&gt; and Pam Halpert ( &lt;unk&gt;enna Fischer &lt;unk&gt; worry that they &lt;unk&gt;ve come on too strong. Only Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; about the new leader. &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from television critics, with many commenting on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s appearance. The episode was also viewed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers and received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent rating among adults between the ages of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, ranking first in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated NBC series of the night. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Synopsis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Michael is waiting in a hotel bar for his replacement &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ickers ( Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to show up. While waiting, he meets a man at the bar and the two instantly hit it off. When Michael calls &lt;unk&gt;ickers to see where he is, it is revealed that the man Michael has been talking to is actually &lt;unk&gt;, though it takes the two some time to actually realize this. &lt;unk&gt; comes to the branch the next day, and most of the staff is eager to make a good first impression. Kevin wears his &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam believe they have started off well by mentioning their baby, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Andy as the office &lt;unk&gt; funny guy &lt;unk&gt; when he reveals that he carries name &lt;unk&gt; around to avoid situations like the one &lt;unk&gt; and Michael were in. Meanwhile, Dwight is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when &lt;unk&gt; wants to make some changes, such as how Erin answers the phone. While &lt;unk&gt; gets annoyed with &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he &lt;unk&gt; hot coffee on his pants and ( at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s urging &lt;unk&gt; eats soap ; Andy tells the camera with &lt;unk&gt; sadness that &lt;unk&gt; this is my life now &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out &lt;unk&gt; butter sandwiches, despite &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; allergy. &lt;unk&gt; then &lt;unk&gt; the staff in the &lt;unk&gt; multipurpose room &lt;unk&gt;, including Dwight, who learned from &lt;unk&gt; that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus &lt;unk&gt; Michael. &lt;unk&gt;im quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. &lt;unk&gt; then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he &lt;unk&gt;s a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won &lt;unk&gt;t be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while &lt;unk&gt; conducts his meeting in the conference room. In another effort to impress &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam bring in &lt;unk&gt;, to which &lt;unk&gt; reacts positively. While they celebrate getting back on his good side, &lt;unk&gt; reveals to the camera that he is in fact indifferent to &lt;unk&gt; and was just being polite. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The episode was written by co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; executive producer Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series.

The episode marked the first appearance of Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; episode arc on the series and is also one of series star, Carell &lt;unk&gt;s last episodes as a regular on the series. &lt;unk&gt; signed on to appear in Steve Carell &lt;unk&gt;s final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, &lt;unk&gt; The Inner Circle &lt;unk&gt;, to make Carell &lt;unk&gt;s transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because &lt;unk&gt; I just think it &lt;unk&gt;s time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. I just thought it was time for my character to go &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell &lt;unk&gt;s last season, because he &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell ’ s swan song &lt;unk&gt;. He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the &lt;unk&gt; film, &lt;unk&gt; : The Legend of Ron &lt;unk&gt;. The Season Seven D&lt;unk&gt;D contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. The cut scenes include a sequence in which Michael and &lt;unk&gt; discuss cancer jokes and the &lt;unk&gt; film Megamind &lt;unk&gt; an animated film that featured the voice of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; while drinking &lt;unk&gt;, shots of Michael and &lt;unk&gt; discussing their enjoyment for coffee, and Dwight attempting to appease his new boss. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ratings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In its original American broadcast, &lt;unk&gt; Training Day &lt;unk&gt; was viewed by an estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers and received a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rating &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; share among adults between the ages of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;.

IGN writer &lt;unk&gt; White wrote that &lt;unk&gt; was not given a proper introduction and that he wasn &lt;unk&gt;t distinguished from Michael &lt;unk&gt;s character. She also went on to criticize &lt;unk&gt;im, Pam and Dwight &lt;unk&gt;s reaction to &lt;unk&gt; as the new manager, particular that of &lt;unk&gt;im and Pam, writing that &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s becoming &lt;unk&gt; obvious that the longtime writers don &lt;unk&gt;t know what to do with them anymore &lt;unk&gt;. However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season &lt;unk&gt;s improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; rating, denoting a &lt;unk&gt; good &lt;unk&gt; episode. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club reviewer Myles &lt;unk&gt; praised Michael &lt;unk&gt;s reactions to the office easily ignoring him for &lt;unk&gt;, calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone &lt;unk&gt; quite effective &lt;unk&gt;, and that Dwight &lt;unk&gt;s reaction to not being suggested to be Michael &lt;unk&gt;s replacement made it more &lt;unk&gt; meaningful &lt;unk&gt;. Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not &lt;unk&gt; sophisticated &lt;unk&gt; enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look &lt;unk&gt; stupid &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; cheap humor &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; enormously shallow laughter &lt;unk&gt;. He ultimately gave the episode a &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between &lt;unk&gt; and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael &lt;unk&gt; being &lt;unk&gt; about not being the center of attention every minute of every day &lt;unk&gt;, negatively comparing it to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Party &lt;unk&gt;. Despite this, he noted that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s presence did involve several funny moments. Bonnie &lt;unk&gt;, for Paste, was more positive, writing that she preferred the use of comedy, following the emotional episode, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sale &lt;unk&gt;. She ultimately gave it an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. Will &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s performance was especially noted by critics. &lt;unk&gt; complimented &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; performance, but called his character &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; praised his dynamic with Carell, comparing it to their previous roles in &lt;unk&gt;. His later appearances in the series also received similar mixed reviews For instance, &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s scenes a &lt;unk&gt; momentum killer &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Michael &lt;unk&gt;, whereas Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called his performance in the same episode &lt;unk&gt; pure magic &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is a song by Irish rock band &lt;unk&gt;. It is the opening track from their &lt;unk&gt; album The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree and was released as the album &lt;unk&gt;s third single in August &lt;unk&gt;. The song &lt;unk&gt;s hook is a repeating guitar &lt;unk&gt; using a delay effect, played during the song &lt;unk&gt;s introduction and again at the end. Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person &lt;unk&gt;s religion and income based on the street on which they lived, particularly in Belfast. During the band &lt;unk&gt;s difficulties recording the song, producer Brian Eno considered &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt;s tapes to have them start from scratch. &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was praised by critics and became a commercial success, peaking at number thirteen in the &lt;unk&gt;S, number fourteen in Canada, number ten in the Netherlands, and number four in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in &lt;unk&gt; on The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. The song was performed on a Los Angeles &lt;unk&gt; for the filming of its music video, which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music &lt;unk&gt;ideo. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Writing and recording &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The music for &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree sessions. In an upstairs room at &lt;unk&gt; House &lt;unk&gt; his newly purchased home &lt;unk&gt; The Edge used a four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards, bass, guitar, and a drum machine. &lt;unk&gt; that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs, The Edge wanted to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up the ultimate &lt;unk&gt; live &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; song &lt;unk&gt;, so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future &lt;unk&gt; show if he were a fan. After finishing the rough mix, he felt he had come up with &lt;unk&gt; the most amazing guitar part and song of &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; life &lt;unk&gt;. With no one in the house to share the demo with, The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration. Although the band liked the demo, it was difficult for them to record the song. &lt;unk&gt; Adam Clayton said, &lt;unk&gt; At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works &lt;unk&gt;. The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was &lt;unk&gt; many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; producer Daniel Lanois, &lt;unk&gt; that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse &lt;unk&gt;, as we call them. I was holding a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking &lt;unk&gt;. It was ridiculous. &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance. So much time had been spent on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; work &lt;unk&gt; that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch. His idea was to &lt;unk&gt; stage an accident &lt;unk&gt; and have the song &lt;unk&gt;s tapes erased. He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes &lt;unk&gt; up and ready to be recorded over, but this &lt;unk&gt; never took place ; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the &lt;unk&gt; of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno. The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve &lt;unk&gt; in the final months of recording The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, &lt;unk&gt;r. later said of the song, &lt;unk&gt; It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it &lt;unk&gt;s not half the song it is live. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Composition &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is played at a tempo of &lt;unk&gt; beats per minute. The introduction and &lt;unk&gt; are played in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; time signature, while the remainder of the song is in a common &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; signature. The songs opens with an instrumental section, starting with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like sustained &lt;unk&gt; notes. The guitar fades in after &lt;unk&gt; seconds ; this part consists of a repeated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; note &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; dotted eighth &lt;unk&gt; delay effect is used to &lt;unk&gt; play &lt;unk&gt; each note in the &lt;unk&gt; twice, thus creating a rich sound. The bass and drums enter at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The introduction, following a I &lt;unk&gt; I&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt; I&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; vi &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I chord progression, creates a &lt;unk&gt; wall of sound &lt;unk&gt;, as described by Mark Butler, against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes. The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming &lt;unk&gt; sixteenth notes. The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes, respectively, while Bono &lt;unk&gt;s vocal performance, in contrast, varies greatly in its &lt;unk&gt;, ( &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; ; he &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; he allows his voice to crack &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as well as timing by his usage of &lt;unk&gt; to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat. This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line &lt;unk&gt; burning down love &lt;unk&gt; ( A &lt;unk&gt; G &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song, the &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; burning &lt;unk&gt;. In later choruses, Bono sings &lt;unk&gt; blown by the wind &lt;unk&gt; with the same melody, stretching the same note even longer. After the third chorus, the song &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; is played, the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction, with a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; note guitar &lt;unk&gt; played against sustained &lt;unk&gt; notes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lyrics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast, Northern Ireland, where a person &lt;unk&gt;s religion and income are evident by the street they live on. He contrasted this with the &lt;unk&gt; he felt when visiting Ethiopia, saying : &lt;unk&gt;... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren &lt;unk&gt;t such divisions, a place where the streets have no name. To me, that &lt;unk&gt;s the way a great rock &lt;unk&gt; n &lt;unk&gt; roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together... Maybe that &lt;unk&gt;s the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all. &lt;unk&gt; Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an &lt;unk&gt; bag while staying in a village. According to him, the song is ostensibly about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, elevation, whatever you want to call it. &lt;unk&gt; Bono, who compared many of his lyrics prior to The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree to &lt;unk&gt; sketches &lt;unk&gt;, said that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; is more like the &lt;unk&gt; of old than any of the other songs on the LP, because it &lt;unk&gt;s a sketch &lt;unk&gt; I was just trying to sketch a location, maybe a spiritual location, maybe a romantic location. I was trying to sketch a feeling. &lt;unk&gt; The open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations. &lt;unk&gt;ournalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send &lt;unk&gt; a message of hope &lt;unk&gt; and wish for a &lt;unk&gt; world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion &lt;unk&gt;. With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;m not sure, really, about that. I used to think it was Belfast... &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono &lt;unk&gt;s and his wife Ali &lt;unk&gt;s visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ended lyrics : &lt;unk&gt; I can look at it now and recognize that &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt; has one of the most &lt;unk&gt; couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don &lt;unk&gt;t communicate. But if you &lt;unk&gt;re flip or &lt;unk&gt; about it, then you do. That &lt;unk&gt;s one of the &lt;unk&gt; I &lt;unk&gt;ve come to terms with. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Originally, the third single from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree was meant to be the song &lt;unk&gt; Red Hill &lt;unk&gt; Town &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was released instead, in August &lt;unk&gt;. The single was released on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, cassette and CD single formats. Three B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides were featured on the single, including &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Thing &lt;unk&gt;, except for the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch release, which only featured the latter two tracks. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch single featured &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt; on side A of the record ( despite being a &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; side &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape. Although not as successful as the album &lt;unk&gt;s first two singles, the song did chart well. In the &lt;unk&gt;.S., the song peaked at number &lt;unk&gt; on the Billboard Hot &lt;unk&gt; and number &lt;unk&gt; on the Album Rock Tracks charts. The song reached number four on the &lt;unk&gt;K Singles Chart, and it topped the Irish Singles Chart. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music video &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles, and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc &lt;unk&gt; stating that &lt;unk&gt; is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people. Police show up to the set and inform the band &lt;unk&gt;s crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing, due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance. Two minutes into the video, &lt;unk&gt; are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; and S. Main St., and perform &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are &lt;unk&gt; the police. The video for &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was directed by &lt;unk&gt; Avis and produced by Michael &lt;unk&gt; and Ben &lt;unk&gt;. The band attracted over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people during the video &lt;unk&gt;s filming, which took place on the &lt;unk&gt; of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The band &lt;unk&gt;s performance on a &lt;unk&gt; in a public place was a reference to The Beatles &lt;unk&gt; final concert, as depicted in the film Let It Be. During the shoot &lt;unk&gt; played an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; song set, which included four performances of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be &lt;unk&gt; by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. &lt;unk&gt; was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day &lt;unk&gt; almost in real time &lt;unk&gt;, and that &lt;unk&gt; getting &lt;unk&gt; was an integral part of the plan. &lt;unk&gt; Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in &lt;unk&gt; that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to &lt;unk&gt; the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded version of the song. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music &lt;unk&gt;ideo at the &lt;unk&gt; Grammy Awards. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt; was released on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. The song developed from the band &lt;unk&gt;s interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as &lt;unk&gt; a kind of Afro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rhythmic piece &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; a study in rhythm. &lt;unk&gt; The bass riff in the song, inspired by the &lt;unk&gt;, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton &lt;unk&gt;s unused bass parts. Mullen &lt;unk&gt;s drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono &lt;unk&gt;s trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase &lt;unk&gt; Race against time &lt;unk&gt;. Bono said of the song, &lt;unk&gt; It reminds me of the desert. The desert is so empty, but it &lt;unk&gt; with a strange kind of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an &lt;unk&gt; African flavour &lt;unk&gt; and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel. The track was used in the Miami &lt;unk&gt;ice episode &lt;unk&gt; Child &lt;unk&gt;s Play &lt;unk&gt;, and is the only one of the single &lt;unk&gt;s B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides that was never played live. &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt; was written in support of the Artists &lt;unk&gt;nited Against &lt;unk&gt; project, which protested the South African apartheid. In &lt;unk&gt;, Bono participated in Steven &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick &lt;unk&gt;agger of The Rolling Stones. When Richards and &lt;unk&gt;agger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre, as most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s. Bono realised that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had no tradition &lt;unk&gt;, and he felt as if they &lt;unk&gt; were from outer space &lt;unk&gt;. This inspired him to write the blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; influenced song &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt;, which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded by &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; single while the band returned to Dublin during in May &lt;unk&gt; during a break between the first and second legs of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. The song was described by Musician as &lt;unk&gt; tough and raw, with Bono in &lt;unk&gt; and confident voice, &lt;unk&gt; by a &lt;unk&gt; bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based guitar. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Silver and Gold &lt;unk&gt; was played live on The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; album and &lt;unk&gt;, Rattle and Hum. Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary edition of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. The studio version was also included on the limited edition B &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sides bonus disk of the band &lt;unk&gt;s first compilation album, The Best of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Thing &lt;unk&gt; was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday. The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play. Some of Bono &lt;unk&gt;s lyrics have been described as reminiscent of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lennon. The Edge described it as &lt;unk&gt; a beautiful song... which is pop as it should be &lt;unk&gt; not produced out of existence, but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity &lt;unk&gt;, also noting that &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s very new for us. &lt;unk&gt; It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in &lt;unk&gt; as a single in its own right for The Best of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track, along with &lt;unk&gt; Race Against Time &lt;unk&gt;, is &lt;unk&gt; an indicator of what &lt;unk&gt; might have made instead of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Critical reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;pon the release of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, critics praised &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;. Steve &lt;unk&gt; of The Boston Globe noted the &lt;unk&gt; bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; like tones from the Edge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; e &lt;unk&gt; a search for heaven &lt;unk&gt; and along with the subsequent track on the album, &lt;unk&gt; I Still Haven &lt;unk&gt;t Found What I &lt;unk&gt;m Looking For &lt;unk&gt;, these songs showed how the group were &lt;unk&gt; pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers &lt;unk&gt;. The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments, saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest. Rolling Stone called it &lt;unk&gt; assertive rock &lt;unk&gt; in their review of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree. The San Diego &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Tribune said of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the music charges, like someone fleeing for life &lt;unk&gt;. The Washington Post said the track is &lt;unk&gt; a bit oblique lyrically, but the implications are clear in Bono &lt;unk&gt;s resolute delivery, Dave ( the Edge &lt;unk&gt; Evan &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; guitar, Adam Clayton &lt;unk&gt;s cathedral bass and Larry Mullen &lt;unk&gt;s rolling thunder drums &lt;unk&gt;. NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album &lt;unk&gt; starts by spitting furiously &lt;unk&gt;. The publication praised Bono &lt;unk&gt;s impassioned singing and The Edge &lt;unk&gt;s guitar playing, which transformed the instrument into &lt;unk&gt; something more than an &lt;unk&gt; abused piece of wood &lt;unk&gt;. The review commented that the &lt;unk&gt; last ten seconds are &lt;unk&gt; beautiful &lt;unk&gt;. The Rocket wrote that the song builds a &lt;unk&gt; wall of sound &lt;unk&gt; that Bono &lt;unk&gt;s vocals cut through with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, as the lyrics &lt;unk&gt; the need for personal spirituality &lt;unk&gt;. The reviewer compared the opening riff to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Reviewing The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an &lt;unk&gt; epic opener &lt;unk&gt;. The service &lt;unk&gt;s Steve Huey, in a review of the song, praised its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, propulsive rhythmic drive and &lt;unk&gt; chorus &lt;unk&gt;, qualities he singled out for making it a fan favorite. He called the song the &lt;unk&gt; perfect album &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; opener &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; slow build of its arrangement toward a climactic peak &lt;unk&gt;. Huey also called Bono &lt;unk&gt;s delivery &lt;unk&gt; passionate and grandiose &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; his commitment to the material &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He believed the combination of his vocals and the band &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; sonic power &lt;unk&gt; is what gave &lt;unk&gt; its &lt;unk&gt; tremendous force &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Live performances &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; made its concert debut on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Arizona on the opening night of The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour. It has since been played at nearly every full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; length concert that &lt;unk&gt; has &lt;unk&gt;, totaling over &lt;unk&gt; performances as of &lt;unk&gt;. The song is widely regarded as one of the group &lt;unk&gt;s most popular live songs. Bono said of it, &lt;unk&gt; We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives, but when we go into that song, everything changes. The audience is on its feet, singing along with every word. It &lt;unk&gt;s like God suddenly walks through the room. &lt;unk&gt; On The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour, &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; was most often used to open concerts. Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting. The San Diego &lt;unk&gt;nion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Tribune wrote that, &lt;unk&gt; From the &lt;unk&gt; sonic opening strains of &lt;unk&gt; the song &lt;unk&gt;, this audience was up, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where &lt;unk&gt; the power afforded their songs is scary &lt;unk&gt;, noting that during the song &lt;unk&gt;s opening, &lt;unk&gt; the arena &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In other reviews, the song was called : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; powerful &lt;unk&gt;. Out of the &lt;unk&gt; shows during The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree Tour, &lt;unk&gt; Streets &lt;unk&gt; was played at all except &lt;unk&gt; of the concerts. During the &lt;unk&gt; Tour which took place in &lt;unk&gt; and the beginning of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Streets &lt;unk&gt; was only left out of the set list at one of the &lt;unk&gt; concerts. The song was performed at every show on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Tour. Concerts from this tour were elaborate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that Bono performed as a variety of characters, but for the end of the main set, the group reverted to playing classics, including &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, straight. Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree &lt;unk&gt;s photo shoot. The video was &lt;unk&gt; up for humorous effect &lt;unk&gt; NME described the effect as giving it a &lt;unk&gt; silly, Charlie &lt;unk&gt; quality &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens. This video would make a return during performances on the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; legs of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tour. Some of the Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt; synthpop cover of the song ( titled &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can &lt;unk&gt;t Take My Eyes off You &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys &lt;unk&gt; cover. Critics welcomed the song in the group &lt;unk&gt;s setlist : The Independent said the song &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; instant euphoria, as &lt;unk&gt; do what they &lt;unk&gt;re best at, slipping into epic rock mode, playing music made for the arena &lt;unk&gt;. In two other local newspaper reviews, critics praised the song &lt;unk&gt;s inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits. For the PopMart Tour of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Tour. The set &lt;unk&gt;s massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an &lt;unk&gt; astonishing, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style trip into the heart of a &lt;unk&gt;, psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Near the end of the song, peace &lt;unk&gt; were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set &lt;unk&gt;s golden arch were projected upwards. Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;FO landing site &lt;unk&gt;. Shortly before the third leg of the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, the September &lt;unk&gt; attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band &lt;unk&gt;s first show in New York City following the attacks, the band performed &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt;, and when the stage lights illuminated the audience, the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. The experience was one inspiration for the song &lt;unk&gt; City of &lt;unk&gt; Lights &lt;unk&gt;. The band paid tribute to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl &lt;unk&gt; halftime show on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. The performance featured the names of the September &lt;unk&gt; victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s appearance was later ranked number &lt;unk&gt; on Sports Illustrated &lt;unk&gt;s list of &lt;unk&gt; Top &lt;unk&gt; Super Bowl &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. For the &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour, the group originally considered dropping the song from their &lt;unk&gt;, but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this. All &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song, which were accompanied by the stage &lt;unk&gt;s LED video &lt;unk&gt; displaying African flags. On the tour &lt;unk&gt;s opening night, this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village. He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle, saying, &lt;unk&gt; And here it was, nearly twenty years later, coming back to Africa, all the stuff about &lt;unk&gt; lands and &lt;unk&gt; making sense for the first time. &lt;unk&gt; The song was also played at the preview screening of the band &lt;unk&gt;s concert film &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;D at the &lt;unk&gt; Cannes Film Festival. At the Glastonbury Festival &lt;unk&gt;, The Edge accompanied rock band &lt;unk&gt; for a live cover version of the track, later playing it with &lt;unk&gt; while headlining Glastonbury in &lt;unk&gt;. Live performances of &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum, Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; : Live from Sydney, and PopMart : Live from Mexico City, as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts, Zoo T&lt;unk&gt; Live and Hasta la &lt;unk&gt;ista Baby! &lt;unk&gt; Live from Mexico City. A second version from the PopMart Tour was featured on Please : &lt;unk&gt; Live EP, and later on the &lt;unk&gt;.S. &lt;unk&gt; Please &lt;unk&gt; single. A live recording from Boston during the &lt;unk&gt; Tour was featured in the concert film &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : Live from Boston, and on the &lt;unk&gt; Walk On &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Electrical Storm &lt;unk&gt; singles. The concert video and album &lt;unk&gt; Go Home : Live from &lt;unk&gt; Castle, Ireland featured another performance from the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, and later performances were featured in the concert films &lt;unk&gt;ertigo &lt;unk&gt; : Live from Chicago and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;D ( &lt;unk&gt;ertigo Tour &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Rose Bowl ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Tour &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; digital album, Live from the Point Depot, contains a performance from the &lt;unk&gt; Tour, only available as part of The Complete &lt;unk&gt; digital box set. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; magazine named &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; most exciting tune ever &lt;unk&gt;. The following year, &lt;unk&gt; ranked the song at number &lt;unk&gt; in a special edition titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Best Songs Ever &lt;unk&gt;. Three years later, the magazine &lt;unk&gt;s readers voted the track the &lt;unk&gt;rd &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; greatest song in history. Rolling Stone ranked the song at number &lt;unk&gt; on its list of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time. &lt;unk&gt; In a &lt;unk&gt; poll by fan site &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; named &lt;unk&gt; Where the Streets Have No Name &lt;unk&gt; as their favourite song from The &lt;unk&gt;oshua Tree, ranking it as the most popular song from the album. In &lt;unk&gt;, American sports network ESPN used the track, among other &lt;unk&gt; songs, in commercials for the &lt;unk&gt; FIFA World Cup, with the South African &lt;unk&gt; Gospel Choir adding vocals to the song. The advertisement, titled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Island &lt;unk&gt;, portrays South African political prisoners during the apartheid era forming a soccer team. There are plans to bring a recording of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; supported performance to retail. Composer &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; used the introductory guitar theme in his &lt;unk&gt; piece for wind ensemble, Aurora &lt;unk&gt;. The song &lt;unk&gt;s introduction was used by the &lt;unk&gt;ancouver Canucks hockey team at the start each of their home games, when the players take to the ice. The Baltimore &lt;unk&gt; also use the song as they enter M &lt;unk&gt; T Bank Stadium before home games. The Marquette Golden Eagles men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team uses this song in their entrance video before all home games at the &lt;unk&gt; Harris Bradley Center. The song is also used by the Wisconsin &lt;unk&gt; football team for their entrance video at Camp Randall Stadium prior to all home games. The Kansas &lt;unk&gt; men &lt;unk&gt;s basketball team uses the song during their starting &lt;unk&gt; at Allen &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Track listing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Personnel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Charts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction ( often referred to as simply the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;. The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; while studying the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt;. As originally described, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; involves the activation of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or &lt;unk&gt; acid promoter. The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ring closure which forms the &lt;unk&gt; product ( See &lt;unk&gt; below &lt;unk&gt;. As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; provided that they follow a similar &lt;unk&gt; pathway. The success of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; as both motifs in natural products ( including &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;, and a &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and as useful synthetic &lt;unk&gt; for total synthesis. The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The mechanism of the classical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by &lt;unk&gt; to be an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and is outlined below. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; by the acid catalyst generates a &lt;unk&gt; cation which undergoes a &lt;unk&gt; allowed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as dictated by the Woodward &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Hoffman rules. This generates an &lt;unk&gt; cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hydrogen. Subsequent &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; produces the &lt;unk&gt; product. As noted above, variants that deviate from this template are known ; what &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in particular is the generation of the &lt;unk&gt; cation followed by &lt;unk&gt; ring closure to an &lt;unk&gt; cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule must be in the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans &lt;unk&gt; s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The &lt;unk&gt; of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; substituted substrates having an increased population of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; due to &lt;unk&gt; strain. &lt;unk&gt; of an electron &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation. Similarly, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; substitution directed inward &lt;unk&gt; the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trans conformation so severely that E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Z &lt;unk&gt; has been shown to occur in advance of &lt;unk&gt; on a wide range of substrates, yielding the trans &lt;unk&gt; regardless of initial configuration. In this way, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a rare example of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction, whereas most &lt;unk&gt; are &lt;unk&gt;. The example below uses &lt;unk&gt; hydride to trap the &lt;unk&gt; cation so that no elimination occurs. ( See &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; below &lt;unk&gt; Along this same vein, &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt; of the type studied extensively by Marcus &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a large amount of &lt;unk&gt; strain in the s &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Classical &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Though &lt;unk&gt; following the general template above had been observed prior to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s involvement, it was his study of the &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; vinyl &lt;unk&gt; that marked the first major examination of this process. &lt;unk&gt; correctly reasoned that the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in situ to form a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; before ring closure to the &lt;unk&gt; product. The reaction shown below involves an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction to generate the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s when several syntheses employing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were published. &lt;unk&gt; below are key steps in the syntheses of &lt;unk&gt; and Nor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that generates the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The classical version of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to &lt;unk&gt;. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to &lt;unk&gt; ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and &lt;unk&gt; of the intermediate. Strong Lewis or &lt;unk&gt; acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These &lt;unk&gt; are not compatible with sensitive functional groups, limiting the substrate scope. Despite the &lt;unk&gt; possibility for catalysis, multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction. This limits the atom economy of the reaction. The elimination step is not &lt;unk&gt; ; if multiple &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are available for elimination, various products are often observed as mixtures. This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as &lt;unk&gt; separation is typically required. &lt;unk&gt; destroys a potential &lt;unk&gt;, decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction. &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; is sometimes not &lt;unk&gt;, meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern variants &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on &lt;unk&gt; its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, &lt;unk&gt; the reaction with more mild &lt;unk&gt; to improve functional group tolerance, directing the &lt;unk&gt; of the elimination step, and improving the overall &lt;unk&gt;. These have been successful to varying degrees. Additionally, modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction, either by generating the &lt;unk&gt; cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the &lt;unk&gt; cation &lt;unk&gt; intercepted &lt;unk&gt; in various ways. Furthermore, enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed. The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took advantage of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; silicon effect in order to direct the &lt;unk&gt; of the elimination step. This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Illinois, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron &lt;unk&gt; to promote the reaction. With &lt;unk&gt; products, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was selected for to varying degrees. The silicon &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product &lt;unk&gt;, shown below. The &lt;unk&gt; takes place before elimination of the &lt;unk&gt; alcohol &lt;unk&gt;, so that the resulting &lt;unk&gt; of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; anti to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Drawing on the &lt;unk&gt; effects compiled over various trials of the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Rochester developed a paradigm for &lt;unk&gt; polarized &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in which electron &lt;unk&gt; and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl &lt;unk&gt; and vinyl &lt;unk&gt; in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; elimination. In addition, the electron withdrawing group increases the &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; proton, allowing selective formation of the trans &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; via &lt;unk&gt;. It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a &lt;unk&gt; or withdrawing group alone, although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield, reaction time, etc. &lt;unk&gt; is typically lower. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Alternative cation generation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By extension, any &lt;unk&gt; cation regardless of its origin is capable of undergoing a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. There have been a large number of examples published where the &lt;unk&gt; cation is arrived at by a variety of &lt;unk&gt;. One such example involves the silver &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ring opening of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of &lt;unk&gt; silver chloride. In the total synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of a vinyl &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; likewise generates a &lt;unk&gt; cation via ring opening of the resultant &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Once the &lt;unk&gt; has occurred, an &lt;unk&gt; cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, respectively. &lt;unk&gt; cation trapping has been developed extensively by &lt;unk&gt; G. West of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Alberta and his review covers the field. The &lt;unk&gt; cation can be trapped with &lt;unk&gt; and carbon &lt;unk&gt; and can also undergo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with various &lt;unk&gt; partners. &lt;unk&gt; below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a &lt;unk&gt; core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity. &lt;unk&gt; trapping with various &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; less common. In one study, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is paired with a Michael reaction using an &lt;unk&gt; catalyst to initiate nucleophilic &lt;unk&gt; addition of the &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In this tandem reaction the &lt;unk&gt; catalyst is required for both &lt;unk&gt; : it acts as the Lewis acid in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and in the next step the &lt;unk&gt; group of &lt;unk&gt; first coordinates to &lt;unk&gt; in a ligand exchange with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; group. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; variants &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The development of an enantioselective &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a desirable addition to the repertoire of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions. To that end, several variations have been developed utilizing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are also known, in which extant &lt;unk&gt; direct the &lt;unk&gt;. Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of &lt;unk&gt; ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in turn sets the &lt;unk&gt; as shown below. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; directed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way. In the example below, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; group acts to direct the &lt;unk&gt; by preventing the distant &lt;unk&gt; from rotating &lt;unk&gt; towards &lt;unk&gt; it via unfavorable &lt;unk&gt; interaction. In this way the silicon acts as a &lt;unk&gt; auxiliary. ( The starting material is not &lt;unk&gt; but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; substrates can exhibit axial to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transfer if &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are used. The example below generates a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yield and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; enantiomeric excess. &lt;unk&gt; has additionally developed a camphor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based auxiliary for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of &lt;unk&gt;. The key step employs an unusual mixture of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as solvent. The first &lt;unk&gt; Lewis acid promoted asymmetric &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was reported by &lt;unk&gt; Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ligand complexes with up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ee. The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Related Reactions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are generally also subsumed under the same name.

Other such extensions have been given similar names, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Because they &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; cation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; electron &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; often severely impede &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Building from this, several &lt;unk&gt; ring openings of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have been reported. These are typically referred to as retro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reaction ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions &lt;unk&gt; have few instances ; there is one example of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reported ( shown below &lt;unk&gt;, and several &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer from poor &lt;unk&gt;, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stabilization of the &lt;unk&gt; cation by electron donation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a &lt;unk&gt; American black comedy film directed by Seth Gordon, written by Michael &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;onathan Goldstein, based on a story by &lt;unk&gt;. It stars &lt;unk&gt;ason Bateman, Charlie Day, &lt;unk&gt;ason Sudeikis, &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, Kevin Spacey, and &lt;unk&gt;amie &lt;unk&gt;. The plot follows three friends, played by Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, who decide to murder their respective overbearing, abusive bosses, portrayed by Spacey, Aniston and Farrell. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s script was bought by New Line Cinema in &lt;unk&gt; and the film spent six years in various states of pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; production, with a variety of actors attached to different roles. By &lt;unk&gt;, Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; had rewritten the script, and the film finally went into production. The film premiered in Los Angeles on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and received a wide release on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The film exceeded financial expectations, &lt;unk&gt; over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in the first three days, making it the number two film in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States during its opening weekend, and going on to become the highest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; grossing black comedy film of all time in &lt;unk&gt; dollars, breaking the record previously set by The War of the Roses in &lt;unk&gt;. The film grossed over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million worldwide during its theatrical run. The film opened to positive critical reception, with several critics praising the ensemble cast, with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark, humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;. A sequel, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, was released on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Nick &lt;unk&gt; ( Bateman &lt;unk&gt; and Dale &lt;unk&gt; ( Day &lt;unk&gt; are friends who &lt;unk&gt; their bosses.

In search of a &lt;unk&gt;, the trio meet Dean &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an ex &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; con who agrees to be their &lt;unk&gt; murder consultant &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other &lt;unk&gt;s bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents.

The next night, Kurt watches &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt;s home, but she &lt;unk&gt; and has sex with him. Nick and Dale &lt;unk&gt; wait outside Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. &lt;unk&gt; discovers Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, &lt;unk&gt; his wife &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;ulie Bowen &lt;unk&gt; is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness. Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free.

The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; he murdered &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is sentenced to &lt;unk&gt; years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails &lt;unk&gt;ulia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient, while &lt;unk&gt;ones secretly records the act. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cast &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ason Bateman as Nick &lt;unk&gt; An executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through &lt;unk&gt; in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him. &lt;unk&gt; wrote the role specifically for Bateman. Charlie Day as Dale &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss. Described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; romantic &lt;unk&gt; in love with his fianc&lt;unk&gt;e. Ashton &lt;unk&gt; was in talks for the role at two different points in the lengthy production. Day was considered for the role following his co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; starring performance with Sudeikis in the &lt;unk&gt; film Going the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reuters reported that industry &lt;unk&gt; believed his performance overshadowed the main stars. &lt;unk&gt;ason Sudeikis as Kurt &lt;unk&gt; An account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new, drug &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies. Sudeikis was cast in May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston as Dr. &lt;unk&gt;ulia Harris, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; based the character on a former boss, claiming she was &lt;unk&gt; very sexually aggressive with everybody &lt;unk&gt;. When writing the script, &lt;unk&gt; intended for the role to go to Aniston. He stated, &lt;unk&gt; but &lt;unk&gt; the aforementioned boss &lt;unk&gt; looked more like &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt;. It was like flirting with a &lt;unk&gt;. So I decided for the sake of the movie, let ’ s go with &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston. ” The actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role, wanting to look different from other characters she had played. Colin Farrell as Bobby &lt;unk&gt; Described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and a &lt;unk&gt; corrupt and incompetent &lt;unk&gt; who &lt;unk&gt;s in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he &lt;unk&gt;s doing. &lt;unk&gt; Farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character, stating &lt;unk&gt; This guy thinks he &lt;unk&gt;s God &lt;unk&gt;s gift to women, God &lt;unk&gt;s gift to &lt;unk&gt;, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It &lt;unk&gt;s all part of his grandiose sense of self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; esteem, which is probably &lt;unk&gt; a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, and all kinds of other things. With &lt;unk&gt;, Seth gave me complete license to act as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up as possible. &lt;unk&gt; Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; belly and an affinity for Chinese &lt;unk&gt;. Kevin Spacey as David &lt;unk&gt; President of &lt;unk&gt; Industries. Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman and &lt;unk&gt;eff Bridges had been approached by New Line Cinema to take the role, described as a &lt;unk&gt; master &lt;unk&gt; with an attractive wife. Spacey signed up for the role in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The part was considered &lt;unk&gt; integral &lt;unk&gt; to the film. Gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses ( rather than one single person &lt;unk&gt; to avoid being sued. &lt;unk&gt;amie &lt;unk&gt; as Dean &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones The character had the more &lt;unk&gt; colorful &lt;unk&gt; name &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones &lt;unk&gt;, but it was changed at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s request, with producer &lt;unk&gt;ay Stern commenting that &lt;unk&gt; felt it &lt;unk&gt; was over the line &lt;unk&gt;. The current name was said to be subject to further change, prior to the release of the film. &lt;unk&gt; contributed to his character &lt;unk&gt;s appearance, suggesting full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tattoos and a retro clothing style. &lt;unk&gt; described the appearance as &lt;unk&gt; a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he &lt;unk&gt;s living in his own time capsule. When he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in. &lt;unk&gt; During the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year development of the film, several actors were in negotiations to star, including Owen Wilson, &lt;unk&gt;ince &lt;unk&gt;, Matthew &lt;unk&gt;, Ryan Reynolds, Dax Shepard, and &lt;unk&gt;ohnny &lt;unk&gt;. Donald Sutherland portrays &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt;, Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s father and Kurt &lt;unk&gt;s boss. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Isaiah &lt;unk&gt; was confirmed as joining the cast. &lt;unk&gt; was quoted as saying &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s a smaller role &lt;unk&gt;. He appears as Officer &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ulie Bowen appears in the film as &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s wife. Bowen stated that her character &lt;unk&gt; may or may not be a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the character described as intentionally making her husband jealous. &lt;unk&gt; Gruffudd has a cameo as a male prostitute erroneously hired as a &lt;unk&gt;. Lindsay &lt;unk&gt; appears as Dale &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Stacy. P. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; plays Kenny &lt;unk&gt;, a former investment manager, now &lt;unk&gt; for drinks, while Wendell Pierce and Ron White play a pair of &lt;unk&gt;. Bob &lt;unk&gt; makes a cameo as sadistic &lt;unk&gt; CEO Louis Sherman. &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt;, a screenwriter on the film, cameos as Nick &lt;unk&gt;s co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; worker Carter. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Development &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s script for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s production company Rat Entertainment in &lt;unk&gt; for a six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; figure amount. &lt;unk&gt; initially was interested in directing, but became occupied with directing the comedy Tower &lt;unk&gt;. Frank &lt;unk&gt; and David &lt;unk&gt; were in talks to direct. &lt;unk&gt;onathan Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt;ohn Francis &lt;unk&gt; rewrote the script in &lt;unk&gt;, and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production designer Shepherd &lt;unk&gt; specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses &lt;unk&gt; homes and offices. Nick and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s workplace is the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; bullpen, which was designed to &lt;unk&gt; enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office. &lt;unk&gt; The design team met with financial &lt;unk&gt; and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ranking position in a &lt;unk&gt; and aspiring to an office. Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with &lt;unk&gt; and set &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; to match &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s suit to that of the surrounding &lt;unk&gt; cold grey and blue &lt;unk&gt; color palette of his office. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s home was described as &lt;unk&gt; equally lacking in warmth &lt;unk&gt; as the office but more lavishly decorated and &lt;unk&gt; for show &lt;unk&gt;, including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his &lt;unk&gt; trophy wife &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt;s office was described as a &lt;unk&gt; challenge &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; sensual vibe &lt;unk&gt; into a &lt;unk&gt; office. &lt;unk&gt; approached the design through &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt;s mentality, stating, &lt;unk&gt; She &lt;unk&gt;s a Type A professional at the top of her game, who likes to play cat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mouse, so it &lt;unk&gt;s a completely controlled environment, with &lt;unk&gt; and views into other rooms so she always knows what &lt;unk&gt;s going on &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s highly designed, with rich &lt;unk&gt; and tones, &lt;unk&gt; artwork and subtle lighting &lt;unk&gt; all very &lt;unk&gt; till you step into her private office. The &lt;unk&gt; close, the door locks and you think, &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s the Temple of Doom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Similarly approaching the character &lt;unk&gt;s home, the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street &lt;unk&gt; which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn &lt;unk&gt;t get away with at work. &lt;unk&gt; Bobby &lt;unk&gt;s environments were designed with more contrast, the character being new to the work area. &lt;unk&gt; described the contrast as &lt;unk&gt; the company reflects &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ack &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; human touch, whereas &lt;unk&gt; Bobby &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; home is a &lt;unk&gt; shrine to himself and his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued, &lt;unk&gt; It features a &lt;unk&gt; of anything he finds exotic and erotic, mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Studio &lt;unk&gt; vibe, a makeshift &lt;unk&gt;, lots of mirrors and a &lt;unk&gt; table. &lt;unk&gt; Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon &lt;unk&gt;s interpretation of the character and his &lt;unk&gt; infatuation &lt;unk&gt; with martial arts and &lt;unk&gt; his &lt;unk&gt; of prowess &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Filming of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took place in and around Los Angeles. The production team attempted to find locations &lt;unk&gt; that people haven &lt;unk&gt;t already seen a hundred times in movies and on T&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America &lt;unk&gt; where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was represented by an office building in &lt;unk&gt;, California, with the crew building the set on a vacant floor. For &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chemical &lt;unk&gt;, the production team found a &lt;unk&gt; perfect landscape of pipes and containers &lt;unk&gt; in Santa Fe Springs, surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility. To take advantage of the surrounding imagery, the warehouse required an extensive series of &lt;unk&gt;, including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new &lt;unk&gt; to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland &lt;unk&gt;s character. A &lt;unk&gt; Friday &lt;unk&gt;s in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, was used as a bar frequented by Nick, Dale, and Kurt, while the bar scene where they meet with &lt;unk&gt;ones was staged in downtown Los Angeles. The film was shot digitally using the &lt;unk&gt; Genesis camera. Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise, though Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stars, stating, &lt;unk&gt; My dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn ’ t much that I needed to do ”. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The soundtrack was composed by award &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; winning composer Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, with music contributed by Mike &lt;unk&gt; of Pearl &lt;unk&gt;am, Stefan &lt;unk&gt; of Dave Matthews Band and Money Mark &lt;unk&gt; a collaborator with the &lt;unk&gt; Boys. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Mark worked with musicians Matt Chamberlain, David &lt;unk&gt;, Aaron Kaplan, &lt;unk&gt;ictor &lt;unk&gt;, Chris &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and D&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to develop the music. Major contributions were provided by Mark on keyboard, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; on guitar, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; on bass, &lt;unk&gt; on drums and D&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; recorded the soundtrack at The &lt;unk&gt;illage recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to remain &lt;unk&gt; authentic &lt;unk&gt; to the characters &lt;unk&gt; progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, &lt;unk&gt; The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn &lt;unk&gt;t over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; produced or &lt;unk&gt; and digital in any way. It &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, noisy, and full of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. I knew that if we could &lt;unk&gt; some of this sonic magic in the score, then the &lt;unk&gt; and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued, &lt;unk&gt; We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same &lt;unk&gt; that Money Mark played on Beck &lt;unk&gt;s classic ‘ Where It &lt;unk&gt;s At ’. At the end of the day, Seth &lt;unk&gt; Gordon &lt;unk&gt; and I wanted to produce a score that is as &lt;unk&gt; and full of attitude as the movie itself.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, based on &lt;unk&gt; reviews, with an average rating of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The site &lt;unk&gt;s critical consensus reads, &lt;unk&gt; It &lt;unk&gt;s nasty, uneven, and far from original, but thanks to a &lt;unk&gt; assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; works. &lt;unk&gt; Review aggregate Metacritic gave the film a score of &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;, based on &lt;unk&gt; critics, indicating &lt;unk&gt; mixed or average reviews &lt;unk&gt;. Roger &lt;unk&gt; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it &lt;unk&gt; well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; cast &lt;unk&gt; and commending it for playing to each actor &lt;unk&gt;s strengths. &lt;unk&gt; gave particular praise to Spacey, labeling him &lt;unk&gt; superb &lt;unk&gt;, and Aniston, &lt;unk&gt; her performance to be a &lt;unk&gt; surprise &lt;unk&gt; and a return to form, stating &lt;unk&gt; she has acute comic timing and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sexual &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cheerful and wicked &lt;unk&gt;. Lisa &lt;unk&gt; of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively, calling the film &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;, well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; built, &lt;unk&gt; nasty tale of resentment, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; revenge &lt;unk&gt; and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club &lt;unk&gt;s Nathan &lt;unk&gt; also praised the cast, stating that the picture &lt;unk&gt; succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads, who remain likeable even while &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, adding the &lt;unk&gt; acting more than &lt;unk&gt; for the film &lt;unk&gt;s other failings. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; singled out Day &lt;unk&gt;s performance as &lt;unk&gt; a potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness can elevate a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; farce into a solid mainstream comedy through sheer force of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Edward Douglas of &lt;unk&gt; credited director Seth Gordon with having assembled &lt;unk&gt; the perfect cast &lt;unk&gt;, claiming &lt;unk&gt; the six leads kill in every scene &lt;unk&gt;, but echoed Nathan &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sentiments that Day is the &lt;unk&gt; real standout &lt;unk&gt;. Douglas summarized the picture as &lt;unk&gt; dark fun that works better than expected due to a well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; developed script, an &lt;unk&gt; cast and a director who knows how to put the two together &lt;unk&gt;. A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated &lt;unk&gt; the timing of the cast... is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and appreciated that the script did not attempt &lt;unk&gt; to cut its &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; dose of &lt;unk&gt; or respectability &lt;unk&gt;. The review concluded that &lt;unk&gt; in the ways that count and even when it shouldn ’ t, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; works. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;SA Today &lt;unk&gt;s Scott &lt;unk&gt; awarded the film three out of four stars, labeling it a &lt;unk&gt; surprising comedy that rivals &lt;unk&gt; as the funniest film of the summer, if not the year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; added that &lt;unk&gt; the characters are so likable &lt;unk&gt;, giving particular credit to Sudeikis though also adding praise for the performances of Bateman and Day. The dialogue was also lauded by &lt;unk&gt;, which commented that &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon has a &lt;unk&gt; touch with water &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; cooler talk &lt;unk&gt; even when the water cooler might be spiked with poison. &lt;unk&gt; Leonard &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; considered Day to have had the &lt;unk&gt; breakout role &lt;unk&gt; and offered praise to the performances of the cast, but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell &lt;unk&gt;s character. &lt;unk&gt; concluded &lt;unk&gt; the movie has just enough &lt;unk&gt; to identify it as a &lt;unk&gt; comedy, just enough &lt;unk&gt; to admire, and just the right &lt;unk&gt; among its three male stars, which turns out to be the movie ’ s greatest strength. &lt;unk&gt; Rolling Stone &lt;unk&gt;s Peter Travers gave &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; killer cast &lt;unk&gt;, with specific credit given to Bateman and Day, but was critical of the movie, stating &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt; out on a sharp premise &lt;unk&gt; and that it is a &lt;unk&gt; hit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; miss farce that leaves you wishing it was &lt;unk&gt; than it is &lt;unk&gt; The Guardian &lt;unk&gt;s Philip French called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; a lumbering, &lt;unk&gt; affair &lt;unk&gt;, but admitted &lt;unk&gt; I laughed frequently, probably to the &lt;unk&gt; of my self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; respect. &lt;unk&gt; Nicholas &lt;unk&gt; of The Independent gave a positive review, complimenting Gordon for not allowing the actors &lt;unk&gt; improvisation to be detrimental to the pacing, but felt the movie was not as &lt;unk&gt; dark &lt;unk&gt; as its premise required, saying &lt;unk&gt; what &lt;unk&gt; the film does have comes instead from the &lt;unk&gt; quantity of &lt;unk&gt;, plus a &lt;unk&gt; of homophobia and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Salon &lt;unk&gt;s Andrew O &lt;unk&gt; offered a mixed response, characterizing the film as a &lt;unk&gt; lot &lt;unk&gt; in theory than in practice, but it won &lt;unk&gt;t ruin your Saturday night &lt;unk&gt;. Salon appreciated the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; comic chemistry &lt;unk&gt; between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O &lt;unk&gt; was however critical of the perceived homophobia, &lt;unk&gt; and racism. The Hollywood Reporter &lt;unk&gt;s Kirk &lt;unk&gt; responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon shows no &lt;unk&gt; for turning the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; characters in the script... into anything more than a collection of moments in search of laughs. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate &lt;unk&gt; rage &lt;unk&gt; against the characters &lt;unk&gt; bosses, stating &lt;unk&gt;... there &lt;unk&gt;s every sign that, even without these particular &lt;unk&gt;, Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be &lt;unk&gt; for lack of a better word &lt;unk&gt; total &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; felt that the humor was &lt;unk&gt; rarely actually laugh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loud funny, and never truly dark or daring &lt;unk&gt;. She particularly criticized the all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with &lt;unk&gt; stereotypes &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ustin Chang of &lt;unk&gt;ariety praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, vulgar and juvenile &lt;unk&gt;. Chang echoed the sentiments of The &lt;unk&gt;illage &lt;unk&gt;oice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to &lt;unk&gt; darker, more daring territory &lt;unk&gt; and faulted it for falling back on &lt;unk&gt; over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; top comic exaggeration &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accolades &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The film received several award nominations, including a &lt;unk&gt; Award for Best Supporting Actor for Colin Farrell, and three nominations from the &lt;unk&gt; Comedy Awards, including Comedy Actor for Bateman, Comedy Actress for Aniston, and best Comedy Film. Farrell and Aniston were both nominated for Best On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Screen Dirt &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; MT&lt;unk&gt; Movie Awards, with Aniston claiming the award. Farrell also received a nomination for Best On &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Screen &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Home media &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; obtained the rights to the network premiere of the film. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was released on D&lt;unk&gt;D and Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.

Beginning with the Blu &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ray Disc release of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Green Lantern, Warner Bros. included a code that allows the owner to access a version of the film via &lt;unk&gt;, a cloud storage service which allows streaming or downloading to a variety of devices. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Seth Gordon confirmed in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; that talks were underway for a sequel, after the financial success of the film in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, saying : &lt;unk&gt; Yeah, we &lt;unk&gt;ve definitely discussed it. It &lt;unk&gt;s done well in the States, the film has, so that &lt;unk&gt;s becoming a more &lt;unk&gt; effort now, we &lt;unk&gt;re trying to figure out what the sequel could be. &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was confirmed that a sequel was moving forward, and that Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; would be returning to write the script. New Line was reported to be negotiating with Gordon to return as director, with Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis also expected to return to their roles. On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was confirmed that Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; were in the process of writing the new script. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Goldstein and &lt;unk&gt; confirmed that they had submitted multiple draft scripts for the sequel, and that production had moved towards &lt;unk&gt; the budget. Later in the same month Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were confirmed to be reprising their roles, with &lt;unk&gt; negotiating to return. The film will again be produced by Brett &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ay Stern. In August &lt;unk&gt;, it was announced that Gordon would not be returning to direct because of scheduling conflicts and that the studio was actively searching for a replacement. In September &lt;unk&gt;, Sean Anders was announced as Gordon &lt;unk&gt;s replacement, with &lt;unk&gt;ohn Morris joining the production as a producer. The pair had previously performed a rewrite on Goldstein &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s sequel script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in summer &lt;unk&gt;, but began in November &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey reprised their roles, with Christoph &lt;unk&gt; and Chris Pine joining the cast.  &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England, which was commissioned to mark the &lt;unk&gt; Commonwealth Games ; it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the &lt;unk&gt;K until the completion of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the &lt;unk&gt; Tower of &lt;unk&gt;. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Christie, in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the starting pistol, but at &lt;unk&gt; the B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt;. The sculpture was commissioned in &lt;unk&gt; ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; court settlement totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. In February &lt;unk&gt;, Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential &lt;unk&gt;, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt; spikes remain in storage. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Design and statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B of the Bang originally stood &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall with &lt;unk&gt; hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core. It was angled at &lt;unk&gt; degrees and supported by five &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; long, tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; above the ground. The sculpture weighed &lt;unk&gt; tonnes, with the concrete in the foundations weighing over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tonnes, including a &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt; reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; deep. The sculpture was made from the same &lt;unk&gt; steel ( also known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Ten &lt;unk&gt; as the Angel of the North sculpture, which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its &lt;unk&gt; to water. As part of the design, the spikes &lt;unk&gt; slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture, containing children &lt;unk&gt;s poems and paintings, due to be opened circa &lt;unk&gt;. The location of the time capsule after &lt;unk&gt; is currently unknown. B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at &lt;unk&gt;, in &lt;unk&gt;, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ;. It took its name from a quotation of British &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the starting pistol, but at &lt;unk&gt; The B of the Bang &lt;unk&gt;. The artwork had been nicknamed &lt;unk&gt; by the locals after the popular children &lt;unk&gt;s game from the &lt;unk&gt;s. Prior to the construction of &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Nottingham, B of the Bang was Britain &lt;unk&gt;s tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North, which stands at &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. It was designed to look like an exploding &lt;unk&gt; and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the &lt;unk&gt; Tower of &lt;unk&gt;. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the &lt;unk&gt; Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in &lt;unk&gt; and was designed by Thomas &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Construction and funding &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas &lt;unk&gt; Studio, &lt;unk&gt; Lucas, Flint and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Structures. It was approved at the start of &lt;unk&gt;, with the central core arriving in Manchester on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August &lt;unk&gt;, after which the &lt;unk&gt; spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang. The official unveiling by &lt;unk&gt; Christie took place on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. In total the sculpture cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million to design and construct &lt;unk&gt; twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the North West Development Agency, contributing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Manchester City Council providing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Structural problems and legal action &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The tip of one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned. Four months later, in May &lt;unk&gt;, a second spike had to be cut off by &lt;unk&gt; after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of &lt;unk&gt; tip weights to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the spikes &lt;unk&gt; weights. Despite these modifications, B of the Bang remained &lt;unk&gt; off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to &lt;unk&gt; Get It &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In May &lt;unk&gt; a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for &lt;unk&gt; analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel. It was announced in October &lt;unk&gt; that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November &lt;unk&gt; this culminated in an out &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project &lt;unk&gt;s designers Thomas &lt;unk&gt; Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Lucas Ltd, Flint and &lt;unk&gt; Partnership and &lt;unk&gt; Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in damages for breach of contract and negligence. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Acting on a report in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe &lt;unk&gt;. The report recognised the sculpture &lt;unk&gt;s aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with &lt;unk&gt; made from carbon fibre, although the report &lt;unk&gt; the necessity for extensive testing. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, Antony &lt;unk&gt;, creator of the Angel of the North &lt;unk&gt; to which B of the Bang is often compared &lt;unk&gt; spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, &lt;unk&gt; It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Despite &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plea, removal of B of the Bang began in April &lt;unk&gt;. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm &lt;unk&gt; Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with &lt;unk&gt; cutting equipment. Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture &lt;unk&gt;s return, and in early &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; the core was sold as scrap for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; is the second episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe. The episode was written by executive producer &lt;unk&gt;eff Pinkner and co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;. Abrams, Alex &lt;unk&gt;, and Roberto Orci. When developing the series, they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was the first regular episode of Fringe, and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series. It was directed by Paul A. Edwards. After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old man, Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv &lt;unk&gt; and consultants Peter ( &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt; and Walter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Noble &lt;unk&gt; investigate. They tie the case to the murders of young women, who have all had their &lt;unk&gt; glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus &lt;unk&gt; ( Mark &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an expert in &lt;unk&gt;, is working to help his son Christopher ( Derek Cecil &lt;unk&gt; stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; first aired in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on Fox. An estimated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers watched the episode, a &lt;unk&gt; percent increase from the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics &lt;unk&gt; reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a &lt;unk&gt; section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old man. Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv &lt;unk&gt;, Peter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt;, and Walter Bishop ( &lt;unk&gt;ohn Noble &lt;unk&gt;, new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip &lt;unk&gt; ( Lance &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, believing the case to be part of &lt;unk&gt; The Pattern &lt;unk&gt;, a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local &lt;unk&gt;, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner &lt;unk&gt;ohn Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would &lt;unk&gt; his victims, young women, then make an &lt;unk&gt; along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process. Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he &lt;unk&gt; his car that contains the related files. Once they are retrieved, Olivia makes a connection to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which controls growth in humans, and informs Charlie Francis ( Kirk &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to monitor recent cases where the victims &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been removed. Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in &lt;unk&gt;, Dr. &lt;unk&gt; ( Mark &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to trying to learn more about rapid aging, but Dr. &lt;unk&gt; cannot help them further, though Peter suspects he is hiding something. &lt;unk&gt;nseen by the Fringe division, Dr. &lt;unk&gt; visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer, Christopher ( Derek Cecil &lt;unk&gt;, his son, who suffers from rapid aging syndrome. &lt;unk&gt; warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process. By this time, Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia &lt;unk&gt;s serial murderer. At Walter &lt;unk&gt;s lab, they identify the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been removed. They &lt;unk&gt; the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process. Walter &lt;unk&gt; they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman &lt;unk&gt;s optical nerves induced by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic, they discover the image of a suspension bridge near &lt;unk&gt; and identify the likely location from which it was viewed &lt;unk&gt; the same warehouse that Dr. &lt;unk&gt; visited. The FBI converge on the building, and Olivia and Peter find &lt;unk&gt; about to cut into another victim. Olivia chases off after Christopher, who eventually &lt;unk&gt; to his rapid aging and dies, while Peter, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a bullet, &lt;unk&gt; with Walter to apply a makeshift &lt;unk&gt; to bring the victim back to life. As they &lt;unk&gt; up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to &lt;unk&gt; their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of &lt;unk&gt;, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter &lt;unk&gt;s childhood are void of any details. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Production &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;. Abrams, Alex &lt;unk&gt; and Roberto Orci, and executive producer &lt;unk&gt;eff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams &lt;unk&gt; television series &lt;unk&gt;. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and &lt;unk&gt; : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. &lt;unk&gt; explained, &lt;unk&gt; While we make sure that our episodes are self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; contained &lt;unk&gt; have a beginning, a middle, and an end &lt;unk&gt; the character stories can be serialized. They don &lt;unk&gt;t have to resolve themselves over the course of one show. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series &lt;unk&gt; different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley &lt;unk&gt;s head. &lt;unk&gt;sing plaster to make a prosthetic, they &lt;unk&gt; drilled out the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ed &lt;unk&gt; it open and &lt;unk&gt; went &lt;unk&gt; through a series of molds. &lt;unk&gt; Stanley stated that &lt;unk&gt; it &lt;unk&gt;s really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it &lt;unk&gt;s very gruesome because the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s popping out. &lt;unk&gt; The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gun &lt;unk&gt; ; according to prop master Peter &lt;unk&gt;, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people &lt;unk&gt;s clothing for concealed weapons. &lt;unk&gt;F&lt;unk&gt; Supervisor Christopher &lt;unk&gt; explained that for the eye &lt;unk&gt;s last vision, they used &lt;unk&gt; a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location, &lt;unk&gt; which they then used to &lt;unk&gt; take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher &lt;unk&gt; and Mark &lt;unk&gt; as his father, Dr. Claus &lt;unk&gt;. Other guest actors included Betty &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Amber &lt;unk&gt; Daisy &lt;unk&gt;, Bernie &lt;unk&gt; as old Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, Carmen &lt;unk&gt; as Amy, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ones as a doctor, and Karin &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt;ohn Scott &lt;unk&gt;s sister. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ratings &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; was watched by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million viewers in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, a &lt;unk&gt; percent increase of four million from the pilot. Fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years. Its high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rated lead &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in, House, helped boost Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s ratings for the night, as &lt;unk&gt; percent of House &lt;unk&gt;s total audience and &lt;unk&gt; percent of &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds stayed to watch Fringe. Fringe was also the highest rated program for male &lt;unk&gt;- to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds that evening. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reviews &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; received mixed reviews from television critics. T&lt;unk&gt; Squad writer &lt;unk&gt;ane &lt;unk&gt; thought the episode seemed &lt;unk&gt; all over the place &lt;unk&gt;, and wasn &lt;unk&gt;t sure what to think. She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl &lt;unk&gt;s eye in order to identity her killer, and the &lt;unk&gt; at the very end, when Walter states &lt;unk&gt; If you &lt;unk&gt;ve read my file, then you know the truth about Peter &lt;unk&gt;s medical history &lt;unk&gt;. Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot ; though it was &lt;unk&gt; laden with lots of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and clich&lt;unk&gt;d dialogue, &lt;unk&gt; Fickett understood that it was needed to &lt;unk&gt; new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a &lt;unk&gt; great show &lt;unk&gt;, and he also praised the production level as &lt;unk&gt; top notch &lt;unk&gt;, and Torv &lt;unk&gt;s performance as &lt;unk&gt; very good &lt;unk&gt; as she &lt;unk&gt; brings a unique presence to the show &lt;unk&gt;. The A.&lt;unk&gt;. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C &lt;unk&gt;, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. &lt;unk&gt;osh &lt;unk&gt;ackson of Paste Magazine disliked the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ex &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; aspects that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; solved the puzzles of the first two episodes &lt;unk&gt;, and also criticized perceived &lt;unk&gt; plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim. Despite these flaws, &lt;unk&gt;ackson said he would tune in next week because he would &lt;unk&gt; rather have a show &lt;unk&gt; on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable, and I &lt;unk&gt;m interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve &lt;unk&gt;. Erin Fox of T&lt;unk&gt; Guide also liked &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; better than the pilot because she thought that it &lt;unk&gt; had really cool special effects, awesome Walter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; we also got to &lt;unk&gt; more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt;GO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes, but &lt;unk&gt; after sitting down to watch Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s second episode, &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt;, my concerns have vanished. Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without &lt;unk&gt; any of Fringe &lt;unk&gt;s eleven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; herbs and spices. In fact, the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files is even better defined in the first weekly &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; episode. I &lt;unk&gt;d struggled to find the word to describe it, and the winner is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; has all of the sense of mystery, discovery, and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller, more &lt;unk&gt; space. &lt;unk&gt; Another &lt;unk&gt;GO writer, Alex &lt;unk&gt;, later compared &lt;unk&gt; The Same Old Story &lt;unk&gt; to the similarly &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; plotted The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Files episode &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; concluded that &lt;unk&gt; Fringe wins this one, just for having a slightly less stupid explanation. &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt;, commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stump bonnet cap, is a species of mushroom in the family &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; edible mushroom has a reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped cap up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; in diameter. The thin stem is up to &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; tall, whitish to yellow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The gills are pale brown to pinkish, and the spore print is white. It is a widespread saprobic fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, &lt;unk&gt;, and North America, where it grows in small groups or &lt;unk&gt; on fallen logs and stumps, especially of oak. British mycologist &lt;unk&gt; Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo. &lt;unk&gt; species with which M. &lt;unk&gt; may be confused include M. galericulata and M. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First described as Agaricus &lt;unk&gt; by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in &lt;unk&gt;, it was assigned its current name in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Mycena galericulata var. &lt;unk&gt; ( named by &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and its &lt;unk&gt; Agaricus &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt; ( named by Fries in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, are synonyms. In a molecular study of the large &lt;unk&gt; ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt; was found to be closely related to M. &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt;, and M. &lt;unk&gt;. The specific epithet &lt;unk&gt; means &lt;unk&gt; bent in &lt;unk&gt;. The mushroom is commonly known as the &lt;unk&gt; clustered bonnet &lt;unk&gt; or the &lt;unk&gt; oak &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stump bonnet cap &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The cap is light reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, with a diameter typically ranging from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. Initially &lt;unk&gt; to bell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped to convex, it &lt;unk&gt; during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap. The margin of the cap has minute but distinct &lt;unk&gt;. The surface is moist and smooth, and &lt;unk&gt;. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap &lt;unk&gt;. The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly &lt;unk&gt; odor and taste. The gills have a &lt;unk&gt; attachment to the stem ( that is, running down the length of the stem &lt;unk&gt; and are a pale brownish color with &lt;unk&gt; of red. They are broad ( between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;, and have a close to &lt;unk&gt; spacing, with about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gills reaching the stem. The fragile stem is &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; long by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; thick and yellow to yellow &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, becoming reddish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown to orange &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white &lt;unk&gt;. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is &lt;unk&gt; doubtful &lt;unk&gt; and consumption &lt;unk&gt; best avoided &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Microscopic characteristics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The spores are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;m, broadly ellipsoid, smooth, and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with Melzer &lt;unk&gt;s reagent &lt;unk&gt;. The basidia ( spore &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bearing cells &lt;unk&gt; are four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; spored. The &lt;unk&gt; ( cystidia on the gill face &lt;unk&gt; are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge &lt;unk&gt; are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;m, and have tips that are covered with &lt;unk&gt; projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is &lt;unk&gt;, and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct &lt;unk&gt;, a well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; differentiated &lt;unk&gt; ( a region of tissue immediately under the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; body ( gill tissue &lt;unk&gt; ; it is pale yellowish to &lt;unk&gt; brownish in iodine stain. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Corner defined the varieties M. &lt;unk&gt; var. &lt;unk&gt; and var. &lt;unk&gt; in his &lt;unk&gt; publication on &lt;unk&gt; mushrooms of &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; region &lt;unk&gt; the boundary of the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The variety &lt;unk&gt; ( named after its type locality, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has a cap margin that is not &lt;unk&gt;, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a stone oak tree in the beech family. &lt;unk&gt;ariety &lt;unk&gt;, found in &lt;unk&gt;, has spores that are almost spherical. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Similar species &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; bears some resemblance to M. &lt;unk&gt;, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and is found in eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. &lt;unk&gt;. M. &lt;unk&gt; is often confused with the edible M. galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, size and shape. M. galericulata typically has a &lt;unk&gt; conical cap that is dull gray &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; veins. M. &lt;unk&gt; has a &lt;unk&gt; stem that is bluish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; gray. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Habitat and distribution &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mycena &lt;unk&gt; is a saprobic fungus, deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It &lt;unk&gt; this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and lignin. The fruit bodies of Mycena &lt;unk&gt; grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut &lt;unk&gt; during the spring and autumn. The fungus forms a white, &lt;unk&gt; mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, &lt;unk&gt;apan, &lt;unk&gt;, Turkey, and New Zealand. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chemistry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in &lt;unk&gt; ( Turkey &lt;unk&gt;, M. &lt;unk&gt; was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( &lt;unk&gt; mg per kg &lt;unk&gt; and nickel ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mg &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt;, measured on a dry weight basis. Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum. The fungus has been investigated for its ability to &lt;unk&gt; synthetic &lt;unk&gt; that are used in the textile, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; industries. The &lt;unk&gt; are not readily biodegradable, and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic.  &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland, with a population of under twenty people, some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of &lt;unk&gt; hectares ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square miles &lt;unk&gt;, Papa &lt;unk&gt; is the eighth largest island in Shetland. &lt;unk&gt; of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, &lt;unk&gt;, arches, &lt;unk&gt;, and cliffs. The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation. The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites, as well as the remains of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island. The population reached &lt;unk&gt; or more in the nineteenth century, when a fishing station was opened at &lt;unk&gt; in West &lt;unk&gt;. Subsequently there was a steady decline in population, although the numbers have increased from a low of &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Today the main settlement on the island is &lt;unk&gt;, just to the east of which is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from where the &lt;unk&gt; ferry arrives from its base at West &lt;unk&gt; on the Shetland &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, especially sheep rearing, is the mainstay of island life. Numerous &lt;unk&gt; have occurred around the coast, and the celebrated poem Da Sang o da Papa Men by &lt;unk&gt; recalls the drama of the days when Papa &lt;unk&gt; was a centre for deep &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sea fishing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay. There are &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; of rugged coastline which is &lt;unk&gt; by numerous small &lt;unk&gt; and four larger &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; harbour bay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the east ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; house bay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry &lt;unk&gt;s embarkation point. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guard the harbour entrance to the south. The former is a &lt;unk&gt; island and was a &lt;unk&gt; colony until the &lt;unk&gt;th century ( although it has been suggested that many of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; there were suffering from a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rather than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The latter &lt;unk&gt;s name relates to a story from the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Lord &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is said to have constructed the tiny house at its top, whose ruins are still visible, in order to &lt;unk&gt; preserve &lt;unk&gt; his daughter from men. &lt;unk&gt;nfortunately for his plans, when she left she was found to be pregnant ; in another version of the story, she and her fisherman &lt;unk&gt; successfully &lt;unk&gt;. West &lt;unk&gt;, the inner part of which is called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the main &lt;unk&gt; in the north coast, the smaller &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lying immediately to the west. The main settlement on the island today is &lt;unk&gt;, which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and is surrounded by in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bye land to the east of the hill &lt;unk&gt; ( which runs south from West &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. To the west the island is &lt;unk&gt; by a belt of glacial &lt;unk&gt; about one and a half kilometres in length. Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow &lt;unk&gt; soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to &lt;unk&gt; turf &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior. The highest point on the island is in the north west at &lt;unk&gt; Field, which rises to &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is possibly from the Old Norse for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of stones &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; List of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In addition to the larger &lt;unk&gt; mentioned above there are various other &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; around the coast of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. They include : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, The Horn, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lie &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the north west. They include : &lt;unk&gt;, North &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and The &lt;unk&gt;. In between Papa &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; lies the shallow bank of Papa &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, Stuart Hill, the owner and only resident of the &lt;unk&gt; hectare ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres &lt;unk&gt; island of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( which he has renamed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Island &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made a declaration of dependence, creating the Crown &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King &lt;unk&gt;ames III of Scotland that dates to &lt;unk&gt;, Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency, and thus not a part of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom or of the European &lt;unk&gt;nion. This claim was not recognised by the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The island is composed of a variety of volcanic and &lt;unk&gt; rock formations from the Devonian period. At that time the Scottish &lt;unk&gt; formed part of the Old Red &lt;unk&gt; Continent and lay some &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; degrees south of the equator. The &lt;unk&gt; of Old Red &lt;unk&gt;, laid down from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; million years ago, were created as earlier &lt;unk&gt; rocks, &lt;unk&gt; by the formation of &lt;unk&gt;, eroded and then were deposited into river &lt;unk&gt;. The freshwater Lake &lt;unk&gt; existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa &lt;unk&gt; is largely made up of ashes and &lt;unk&gt; from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but there is also a Devonian fish bed at &lt;unk&gt; Banks. There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves, &lt;unk&gt;, arches, &lt;unk&gt;, cliffs, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; that are amongst the finest in Britain. The &lt;unk&gt; Holl o &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a cave that passes right through the north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west tip of the island. It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through. &lt;unk&gt; ( or Christie &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave, part of the roof of which collapsed in &lt;unk&gt;. Yet another is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Hole &lt;unk&gt; close to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the west. This was the favourite of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Tudor who wrote of the island in his &lt;unk&gt;ictorian memoirs and described the cave as :... in &lt;unk&gt;, so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so &lt;unk&gt; is the water... &lt;unk&gt; with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; like &lt;unk&gt; in a church. In &lt;unk&gt; the spectacular headland, &lt;unk&gt; Da Horn o Papa &lt;unk&gt; fell into the sea during a storm. The nearby &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ecology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, grey seals, killer &lt;unk&gt; and harbour &lt;unk&gt; are frequently seen on and around Papa &lt;unk&gt;. Atlantic &lt;unk&gt;, Arctic and common &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Arctic &lt;unk&gt;, northern &lt;unk&gt;, common &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, ringed &lt;unk&gt; and great black &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backed gull all breed on the island, and numerous migratory species have been recorded. There is a &lt;unk&gt; of wild flowers, including mountain &lt;unk&gt;, spring &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as well as the ubiquitous &lt;unk&gt;. The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa &lt;unk&gt; are a Special Area of Conservation. The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History and archaeology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Human settlement of the island dates from circa &lt;unk&gt; BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as &lt;unk&gt; heel &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Little is known of the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Celtic and Celtic eras, but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; meaning &lt;unk&gt; Big island of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( Celtic monks &lt;unk&gt;, in distinction to Papa Little some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the west. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Norse period &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; is the subject of a &lt;unk&gt; manuscript written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland. It deals with a dramatic incident in the house of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was later to become King &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Norway. There is a circle of stones near the beach at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which are the remains of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, or local assembly. This was the scene of a duel, fought and won by Lord &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was accused of corruption in the &lt;unk&gt; document and was later called ‘ &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; ’. ( The story of his unfortunate daughter is referred to above. &lt;unk&gt; The remains of Duke &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s thirteenth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century house are still visible near &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scots rule and fishing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt; Shetland came under nominal Scottish control, although the Norse &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Norway &lt;unk&gt; kept their Papa &lt;unk&gt; estates until the &lt;unk&gt;th century. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century merchants from &lt;unk&gt; and Hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet. By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, two Scottish &lt;unk&gt;, Thomas &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, and Arthur &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, owned the island. They maintained a prosperous &lt;unk&gt; ( Old Norse : &lt;unk&gt; deep sea &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fishing industry, undertaken in the summer months using six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; boats known as &lt;unk&gt;. In addition to the &lt;unk&gt; colony on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; there may have been another at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; overlooking &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed &lt;unk&gt;th century colony. The island church, which &lt;unk&gt; Kirk Sand in the bay of Fore &lt;unk&gt;, was founded in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site of &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; on the headland between the west end of Kirk Sand and the bay of &lt;unk&gt;. It is called the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; by locals and referred to by the Ordnance Survey as &lt;unk&gt; the site of a &lt;unk&gt; chapel belonging to about the twelfth century &lt;unk&gt;. There is a tradition that the work there was &lt;unk&gt; with by supernatural powers and that each day &lt;unk&gt;s work on the building was destroyed during the night. Eventually the &lt;unk&gt; were moved overnight by these &lt;unk&gt; agencies to the present site of the church and work was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; commenced there successfully. Excavations in &lt;unk&gt; found little besides large blocks of &lt;unk&gt; and a piece of whalebone rib, suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century the &lt;unk&gt; fishing station in West &lt;unk&gt; was opened and the island had a population of &lt;unk&gt; people or more. However, fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam &lt;unk&gt; saw a fall in population from the &lt;unk&gt;s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the &lt;unk&gt;th Earl of &lt;unk&gt;, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent &lt;unk&gt; years as a prisoner before the &lt;unk&gt;uaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in &lt;unk&gt;. Lindsay &lt;unk&gt;s Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe. There are good examples of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or &lt;unk&gt; Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower &lt;unk&gt;, and a rotating upper &lt;unk&gt; driven by the water falling onto the &lt;unk&gt; below. Some were still in use on Papa &lt;unk&gt; in the early years of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of &lt;unk&gt;, at &lt;unk&gt; in the south &lt;unk&gt; of Shetland. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;st centuries &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In common with many small Scottish islands, Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population peaked in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By &lt;unk&gt; the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen &lt;unk&gt; fairly elderly &lt;unk&gt; residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A &lt;unk&gt; and five sheep were offered free of charge to &lt;unk&gt; which brought a flood of applicants. By &lt;unk&gt; the census recorded a population of &lt;unk&gt;. However, by &lt;unk&gt; the population had fallen to &lt;unk&gt; after serious &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early &lt;unk&gt; the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The &lt;unk&gt; census recorded a usually resident population of &lt;unk&gt; - during the decade &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scottish island populations as a whole grew by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Overview of population trends &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The coasts around Papa &lt;unk&gt; have claimed numerous wrecks. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; alone has sunk Dutch, French, German and Norwegian ships. The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles northwest of Papa &lt;unk&gt;, on the evening of &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; while on her way to the village of &lt;unk&gt; to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good but it was not until the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the &lt;unk&gt; and local volunteers ( there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time &lt;unk&gt;, weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the &lt;unk&gt;. A request had been made for the &lt;unk&gt; lifeboat from Orkney, only &lt;unk&gt; miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All &lt;unk&gt; crew perished in the wreck. Only &lt;unk&gt; bodies were recovered, that of &lt;unk&gt;ames Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which were buried in &lt;unk&gt;. The cargo ship SS &lt;unk&gt; ran aground in fog on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt;. On this occasion the conditions were &lt;unk&gt; and only the ship and cargo were lost. In &lt;unk&gt; the Aberdeen trawler &lt;unk&gt; ran aground in &lt;unk&gt; Sound at the bottom of the &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; cliffs. The &lt;unk&gt; man crew were rescued by the &lt;unk&gt; lifeboat, the &lt;unk&gt; being awarded the &lt;unk&gt; silver medal for this rescue. Papa &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most recent &lt;unk&gt; occurred on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor &lt;unk&gt;iking &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Alec &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; came to the scene but was unable to get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions. At the request of Alec Webster, &lt;unk&gt; Station Officer, &lt;unk&gt;, a volunteer crew in a British Airways &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; helicopter from &lt;unk&gt; Airport was &lt;unk&gt;. They managed to &lt;unk&gt; all the boat &lt;unk&gt;s crew to safety within hours of the &lt;unk&gt;, despite the storm force winds. The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at &lt;unk&gt; Airport. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Economy &lt;unk&gt; Transport &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the mainstay of island life. &lt;unk&gt; form the backbone of the agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. &lt;unk&gt; electricity only came to the island at the close of the twentieth century. The Papa &lt;unk&gt; Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. &lt;unk&gt; now sail across the Sound of Papa to West &lt;unk&gt; on the Shetland &lt;unk&gt;. The crossing takes &lt;unk&gt; minutes, and although the &lt;unk&gt; carries cars, there is only one short road on the &lt;unk&gt; visiting &lt;unk&gt; the four main &lt;unk&gt; provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There is an airstrip which &lt;unk&gt; for regular flights from &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Culture and the arts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Papa &lt;unk&gt; sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England. A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott. The writer and journalist &lt;unk&gt;ohn Sands lived on Papa &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for a while during the late nineteenth century. The writer, &lt;unk&gt; and musician, George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa &lt;unk&gt;. It is also the &lt;unk&gt; Papa &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s poem Da Sang o da Papa men, now adopted as part of the &lt;unk&gt; tradition, as set to music by &lt;unk&gt; Manson. The &lt;unk&gt; chorus chant, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt;, is particularly striking. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; da Horn o Papa, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; a hidden piece o water, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; da boat da tide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; da &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; ; We &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fish is &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; refers to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of &lt;unk&gt; were no longer visible. This entailed the boat being some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; west of Papa &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; tide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide. The &lt;unk&gt; final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the &lt;unk&gt; scent o &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; across the water. This is an example of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation. An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem &lt;unk&gt;s composition, so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life, but a noted geographical feature.  &lt;unk&gt; Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; River &lt;unk&gt; The Battle of the &lt;unk&gt; River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian, New Zealand and &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces. Part of the wider &lt;unk&gt; Campaign of the Pacific theatre, the battle was fought in the southern sector of &lt;unk&gt; Island. Coming after the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll in which a strong &lt;unk&gt;apanese counterattack was defeated, the battle occurred in two distinct periods between &lt;unk&gt; April and &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;, as elements of the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced south along the &lt;unk&gt; Road. The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. Following the end of the early fighting, the Australian advance towards the main &lt;unk&gt;apanese concentration at &lt;unk&gt; continued as they struck out towards the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective, &lt;unk&gt; away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies. As the Australian advance stalled, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began harassing the Australian line of communications, and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and into August, the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards &lt;unk&gt; again. &lt;unk&gt;ltimately, though, the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began, bringing the campaign to an end. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Strategic situation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces had landed on &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;, capturing it from the small force of Australians &lt;unk&gt; the island. They had subsequently developed several &lt;unk&gt; on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area. These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major &lt;unk&gt;apanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout &lt;unk&gt;, Allied planners determined that &lt;unk&gt; was vital for &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;apanese base around Rabaul. &lt;unk&gt;S Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape &lt;unk&gt;, on the western coast of the island, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November &lt;unk&gt;. After an initial counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack, the &lt;unk&gt;S Marines had been replaced by a garrison of &lt;unk&gt;S Army troops who began consolidating their position around &lt;unk&gt;, establishing a strong perimeter. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese launched a heavy counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack, which was turned back with heavy casualties. After this, the situation on &lt;unk&gt; became largely static, as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the &lt;unk&gt;S forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around &lt;unk&gt;. In late &lt;unk&gt;, as part of plans to free &lt;unk&gt;S troops up for the Philippines campaign, the Australian II Corps &lt;unk&gt; consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took over responsibility for Allied operations on &lt;unk&gt; from the American &lt;unk&gt;I&lt;unk&gt; Corps. Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December &lt;unk&gt;, initially establishing themselves around the &lt;unk&gt;S base at &lt;unk&gt;. Due to inaccurate intelligence, &lt;unk&gt; mistakenly believed that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces on the island numbered just &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the &lt;unk&gt;apanese from &lt;unk&gt; in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere, rather than maintaining the defensive posture the &lt;unk&gt;S forces had adopted. However, Allied estimates of &lt;unk&gt;apanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of &lt;unk&gt;apanese on the island at this time was closer to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north, it was planned that &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces would be forced into the narrow &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east &lt;unk&gt; west avenues of approach, as well as &lt;unk&gt; them protection against further counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces were concentrated around &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Preliminary moves &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards &lt;unk&gt;. In late March and early April &lt;unk&gt;, they had fought the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines. Meanwhile, the survivors of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese force, heavily demoralised by their defeat, withdrew towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. The Australian &lt;unk&gt;rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south, being tasked with capturing the &lt;unk&gt; River, while the &lt;unk&gt; was also included as an &lt;unk&gt; intermediate objective &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were believed to be directly opposing the &lt;unk&gt;rd Division. The &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on &lt;unk&gt; at the time and was moved up to relieve the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade, which was in need of rest. &lt;unk&gt;nder the command of Brigadier &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, engineers from the &lt;unk&gt;th Field Company, a battery of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mm guns from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Heavy Battery, field artillery from the &lt;unk&gt;nd Field Regiment, and a number of smaller support units. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll replacing the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion while the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the &lt;unk&gt; Road. The brigade &lt;unk&gt;s third battalion &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion &lt;unk&gt; did not join them until the beginning of May, and so the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the &lt;unk&gt; River, in the &lt;unk&gt; area, until the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th could dispatch elements to relieve them. Further inland, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east, defending the brigade &lt;unk&gt;s left, or eastern, flank. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; for as long as possible, and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian &lt;unk&gt;s expected line of advance. The division &lt;unk&gt;s infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll and as a consequence, several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated. The front line positions were assigned to the &lt;unk&gt;th Field Artillery Regiment, while the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Regiment was to hold five &lt;unk&gt; to their rear along and &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; Road, designated &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; through to &lt;unk&gt; E &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;th Field and &lt;unk&gt;th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held &lt;unk&gt; further back, designated &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; G &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear, where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Battle &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Advance to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade took over the forward positions from the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade on &lt;unk&gt; April. Initial &lt;unk&gt; had the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion on the &lt;unk&gt; Road around &lt;unk&gt; Creek, with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th around &lt;unk&gt;, north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll, and the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th, when it arrived to relieve the &lt;unk&gt;th, would be positioned further east &lt;unk&gt; a secondary, parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road. Two days later, &lt;unk&gt; received the order to commence the advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt;, who offered him the support of the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack. In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll, from early May they advanced on a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; battalion front, instead of one. The &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was in the van, moving along the &lt;unk&gt; Road with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th protecting its flank and rear ; while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; further inland the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion, commencing on &lt;unk&gt; May, advanced along the Commando Road from &lt;unk&gt;, after taking over from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion. Moving forward under a &lt;unk&gt; barrage as they moved beyond &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the &lt;unk&gt;apanese, carrying out an attack against &lt;unk&gt;apanese positions around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Creek on &lt;unk&gt; April. &lt;unk&gt; by a troop of Matilda tanks from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Armoured Regiment, an artillery barrage which fired over &lt;unk&gt; shells, two infantry companies &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;th attacked the position while another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The left forward company &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; D &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; reached its objective without trouble ; however, &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; Company &lt;unk&gt; on the right along with the troop of tanks &lt;unk&gt; came up against stiff &lt;unk&gt;apanese resistance and became bogged down. &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the &lt;unk&gt; track. In support of &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; Company, &lt;unk&gt; came forward and raked the jungle, hacking through the &lt;unk&gt; to reveal several &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt;, which were destroyed by the Australian armour. As night fell, &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning. Engineers were brought forward, as was a &lt;unk&gt;, and the gap was &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; heavy fighting, the Australians forced their way across the creek. By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; beyond the creek, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. After this, the Australians continued their advance towards &lt;unk&gt; Creek, which was a further &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; to the southeast. In response, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week, although these were turned back. During this time, the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements, one of which managed to slip through the &lt;unk&gt;apanese defensive positions either side of the &lt;unk&gt; Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the &lt;unk&gt; River about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; south of the main crossing. Further patrols were carried out, as well as a number of ambushes, before the advance was resumed on &lt;unk&gt; April. &lt;unk&gt; their advance, the Australians were supported by three squadrons of &lt;unk&gt; from the Royal New Zealand Air Force &lt;unk&gt; Nos. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons &lt;unk&gt; which bombed and &lt;unk&gt; the ground in front of the advancing infantry, as well as a &lt;unk&gt; barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the &lt;unk&gt;apanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the &lt;unk&gt;, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on &lt;unk&gt; May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade &lt;unk&gt;s engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To &lt;unk&gt; the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire. Meanwhile, the previous day, &lt;unk&gt; May, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north. Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling, which resulted in them being ambushed. They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching, and crossing the river, arriving there on &lt;unk&gt; May. On &lt;unk&gt; May, along the &lt;unk&gt; Road, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again. &lt;unk&gt; with a tank troop in support, they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese. After the lead Matilda &lt;unk&gt;s machine gun jammed, the field gun opened fire on it, damaging it and wounding its crew. Moving around the stricken tank, the second Matilda, armed with a howitzer, opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the &lt;unk&gt;apanese defenders from the position. That night, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage, and the following morning put in a company &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attack. The fighting lasted for over two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; half hours, but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack. In doing so, they suffered one killed and nine wounded, while the attacking &lt;unk&gt;apanese had suffered heavily, losing &lt;unk&gt; men killed. It was the biggest loss since the action at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on &lt;unk&gt; May without further opposition. The previous three weeks in which they had advanced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt; had been costly for them, however, with the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion losing &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Against this, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese had lost at least &lt;unk&gt; killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Crossing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the advance to the &lt;unk&gt;, there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the &lt;unk&gt; en &lt;unk&gt;. This allowed &lt;unk&gt; to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into &lt;unk&gt;apanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the &lt;unk&gt; and subsequently located a strong &lt;unk&gt;apanese position on a feature that became known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance. The main crossing was planned for &lt;unk&gt; May, with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the &lt;unk&gt; Road and the &lt;unk&gt; Track to the east of the river, while on the left the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the &lt;unk&gt;apanese off the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line, crossing at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, advancing straight up the &lt;unk&gt; Road. Preliminary moves began before this, and on &lt;unk&gt; May a platoon from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge. After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a &lt;unk&gt;apanese field gun, they were forced to withdraw. Meanwhile, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; squadrons &lt;unk&gt; now reinforced by No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron &lt;unk&gt; began an eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day aerial campaign, attacking along the length of the &lt;unk&gt; and Commando Roads. During this period, the New Zealanders flew &lt;unk&gt; sorties, while artillery and mortars fired &lt;unk&gt; thousands of rounds &lt;unk&gt;. Two days later, on &lt;unk&gt; May, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; inland and advancing along the Commando Road with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and two batteries of artillery in support. Crossing &lt;unk&gt; yd ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; north of the &lt;unk&gt;, the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing. Nevertheless, shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out, carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on &lt;unk&gt; May. In the centre, the main attack along the &lt;unk&gt; Road began at &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May after &lt;unk&gt; minutes of &lt;unk&gt; by New Zealand &lt;unk&gt; had prepared the ground. &lt;unk&gt; under a &lt;unk&gt; barrage, and with mortar and machine gun support, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve, along with two troops of Matilda tanks. &lt;unk&gt; the forward companies reached their objectives, but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded. The attack was resumed the following day, and the Australians were able to advance to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; however, they were prevented from moving any further as the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;apanese and were forced to go to ground. Finally, a company from the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped. Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature. On the right flank, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. Beginning their move two days earlier, a number of patrols had had contacts with the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. Meanwhile, using &lt;unk&gt; to drag the tanks through the mud, the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river, &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;apanese. The following day, the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective, which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing, and further delayed by stiff resistance. Later, after one of the battalion &lt;unk&gt;s patrols came under heavy fire, the tanks moved up and attacked a &lt;unk&gt;apanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned, leaving behind a &lt;unk&gt; mm gun and a large amount of ammunition. By &lt;unk&gt; May, although there were still a number of &lt;unk&gt;apanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications, most of the Australian objectives had been secured and &lt;unk&gt; up operations began. The last remaining defensive location before the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Ridge, where the &lt;unk&gt;apanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within a short period of time the &lt;unk&gt; Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Rivers. The final phase of the battle cost the &lt;unk&gt;apanese &lt;unk&gt; killed, while the Australians lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the course of the fighting around the &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians lost &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while the &lt;unk&gt;apanese lost at least &lt;unk&gt; men killed. Following the battle, the Australians continued their advance towards &lt;unk&gt; at the southern end of the island. Throughout the remainder of the month and into &lt;unk&gt;une, the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced along the &lt;unk&gt; Road, crossing the &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. Beyond the river, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply, and they consequently occupied a series of deep &lt;unk&gt;. These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade subsequently crossed &lt;unk&gt; River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade in early &lt;unk&gt;uly. As the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade advanced toward the &lt;unk&gt; River, torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt. The height of the river rose &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Road was reduced, in the words of Gavin Long, &lt;unk&gt; to a sea of mud &lt;unk&gt; and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away. This rendered large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the &lt;unk&gt; ; meanwhile, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese continued to harass the Australians, probing their positions and setting mines and traps, targeting the Australian line of communications. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, the &lt;unk&gt;th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around &lt;unk&gt;, at the junction of the &lt;unk&gt; River and the &lt;unk&gt; Road, which included a heavy &lt;unk&gt;apanese artillery bombardment. Australian patrols were resumed in late &lt;unk&gt;uly and continued into August. These attacks proved very costly, particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding. Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards &lt;unk&gt; continued into August, combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on &lt;unk&gt; took place on the &lt;unk&gt; front in the northern sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major combat operations.

Named after General Winfield Scott, who achieved &lt;unk&gt; during the Mexican &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American War, during the middle of the &lt;unk&gt;th century the fort served as a military base for &lt;unk&gt;S Army action in what was the edge of settlement in &lt;unk&gt;. For the next quarter century, it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement, a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War. The current national historic site protects &lt;unk&gt; historic structures, a parade ground, and five acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of restored &lt;unk&gt; prairie, inside the city of Fort Scott. It is open to visitors most days of the year. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott, was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort &lt;unk&gt; and Fort Gibson. It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers, who were migrating from the Eastern &lt;unk&gt;nited States. Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians, as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers &lt;unk&gt; encroachment. The &lt;unk&gt;nited States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to &lt;unk&gt; on the Indian settlements. Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt;s most active days were between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, although it was also used during the Civil War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Army days &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt; were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity. After some delay, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort &lt;unk&gt; and the site. The Army both wanted to &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense &lt;unk&gt; and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage, who had been conducting frequent raids in the area. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April &lt;unk&gt; arrived where Fort Scott would be built, in the Osage &lt;unk&gt; section of modern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day Kansas. After &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; to acquire the land, the rest of Fort Wayne &lt;unk&gt;s garrison left the fort on May &lt;unk&gt; and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nlike most forts for military use, the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary. The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men, animals, and equipment. These buildings were on the edges of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt; parade ground. The post &lt;unk&gt;, Captain Thomas Swords, was in charge of building Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt;s structures, and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie, which had few trees. He had only two &lt;unk&gt; and three carpenters to rely on, as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform. Wood was available, but the mill was built &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away, making transport time consuming. Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood, skilled labor and working equipment. Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort &lt;unk&gt;s construction. As a result, only one &lt;unk&gt; of the five planned officers quarters ( four &lt;unk&gt; and post commandant &lt;unk&gt;s house &lt;unk&gt; was built by &lt;unk&gt;, and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed. In his &lt;unk&gt; inspection of the fort, Colonel George &lt;unk&gt; reported that, in comparison to other frontier forts, he considered Fort Scott &lt;unk&gt; above average &lt;unk&gt;. Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American War, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army redeployed troops to the Southwest. With Fort Scott still uncompleted, officials decided on April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, that no more construction would be done there, after eight years and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. By the time it was finished, it was obsolete ; three years later, it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley. For the average soldier, life at the fort was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ntil the permanent structures were built, soldiers had to live in tents, which lacked comfort. Aside from a few whiskey &lt;unk&gt; and prostitutes, few civilians lived at the fort. Officers had brought their personal slaves with them, including Captain Swords. Five miles East in Missouri was a &lt;unk&gt; shop that supplied soldiers, and quite a few courts &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; martial followed soldiers &lt;unk&gt; going &lt;unk&gt; at the shop. The &lt;unk&gt; rate from the fort ranged from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, due to boredom, irregular pay, and hatred for military life. As no combat took place near the fort, it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base. Hunting was a popular &lt;unk&gt; ; according to Captain Swords, &lt;unk&gt; wolf chasing and duck hunting &lt;unk&gt; was the only way one officer could tolerate the place. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bleeding Kansas &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Two years after the army abandoned the fort, the buildings were sold by auction to civilians, with two being converted to hotels. In &lt;unk&gt; the Kansas &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;, which had kept slavery out of Kansas. &lt;unk&gt; in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery. Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out. Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at the Western Hotel. Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery, but those outside the town tended to the free &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; soil side. During this time, there were local incidents of murder and attempted &lt;unk&gt;, typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Army returns &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the American Civil War, the fort was renewed as a &lt;unk&gt;S military post. In August &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;nion Army took command of Fort Scott, and &lt;unk&gt; it for the war times. The &lt;unk&gt;nited States Army also took over several blocks within the town for &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; functions. The &lt;unk&gt;nion Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners. Troops from Indiana, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin would come to the fort, and either stayed by the fort, or traveled farther, to &lt;unk&gt; Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territory. Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; Troops of the &lt;unk&gt;nion Army. A major supply depot was situated at the fort. Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town, but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the &lt;unk&gt; unstable &lt;unk&gt; Indian Territory ( present &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day state of Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt;, where many of the members of the Five &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were allied with the Confederates. The fort served as a &lt;unk&gt; general hospital &lt;unk&gt; ( large military hospital &lt;unk&gt; and prison until after the war. Following the end of the war, in October &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;S Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled. On &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas. The Post was based at Fort Scott, but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks, and seldom used the original fort. They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers. Some of the latter feared that the railroad, which had been awarded land for development by the &lt;unk&gt;S Government in rights &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; way, would evict them from their &lt;unk&gt; homes. The settlers considered the troops &lt;unk&gt; to the railroads, and &lt;unk&gt; both as enemies. Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery. By the spring of &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;S Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good. From &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, the buildings of the fort were left &lt;unk&gt;, and slowly deteriorated. Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern times &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With the Act of August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott, Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort. On October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service, encompassing &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Today the fort is open throughout the year, save for &lt;unk&gt;, Christmas, and New Years Day. &lt;unk&gt; has declined in recent years. In &lt;unk&gt; visitation was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; in &lt;unk&gt; it was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.

Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment &lt;unk&gt;s ( WWE &lt;unk&gt; One Night Stand &lt;unk&gt; event on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, both performed equally, as One Night Stand received the same rating from Matt &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; felt that &lt;unk&gt; TNA put on a strong &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that was in &lt;unk&gt; large part to little &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Regarding the main event, &lt;unk&gt; gave it a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;, while the World Tag Team Championship match received a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. He gave the Six Woman Tag Team match a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; versus Kurt Angle bout a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship contest was given a &lt;unk&gt; out of &lt;unk&gt;. Wade &lt;unk&gt; of the Pro Wrestling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; reviewed the show. He felt the main event had &lt;unk&gt; lots of action and drama, &lt;unk&gt; but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a &lt;unk&gt; particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; beating someone to win a fight. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a &lt;unk&gt; solid tag match &lt;unk&gt; with some &lt;unk&gt; elaborate sequences &lt;unk&gt; that were &lt;unk&gt; well executed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; stated that the &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship match was a &lt;unk&gt; very good opener. &lt;unk&gt; Regarding the &lt;unk&gt; and Angle bout, &lt;unk&gt; commented that it was a &lt;unk&gt; good match, but short of a classic must &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; see match in part because there were too many &lt;unk&gt; mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; match from Angle that took the crowd out of it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ames Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a &lt;unk&gt; slow, &lt;unk&gt; match &lt;unk&gt; with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; finish. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell stated that the &lt;unk&gt; versus Angle contest was a &lt;unk&gt; fine spotlight singles match, &lt;unk&gt; but was a &lt;unk&gt; bit &lt;unk&gt; when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA &lt;unk&gt;s best wrestlers in a featured singles match. &lt;unk&gt; He went on to say that he felt it was &lt;unk&gt; missing something &lt;unk&gt; and that it &lt;unk&gt; seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear. Caldwell felt the &lt;unk&gt; Division Championship bout was a &lt;unk&gt; very good opening match, &lt;unk&gt; which &lt;unk&gt; could have been a featured match to sell a few additional &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but TNA didn &lt;unk&gt;t give the &lt;unk&gt; Division any focus until the final show before the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Caldwell stated the World Tag Team Championship was &lt;unk&gt; just a slow, &lt;unk&gt; tag match. &lt;unk&gt; Regarding the marriage segment during the show, Caldwell said &lt;unk&gt; it was just a bad, bad, bad segment that died slowly and &lt;unk&gt; in front of the live audience. &lt;unk&gt; Overall, Caldwell felt that &lt;unk&gt; TNA showcased the &lt;unk&gt; Division in the opening match, &lt;unk&gt; but needed more &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the show to balance the slow, &lt;unk&gt; former WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Accident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After &lt;unk&gt; ended, crews began to &lt;unk&gt; the set used for the event. During this time, a man named Kevin &lt;unk&gt; Angus &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was removing a light array when the scaffolding he was positioned on collapsed, causing him to slam against the concrete floor below. He was rushed to the Baptist &lt;unk&gt; Hospital in &lt;unk&gt;, Mississippi where he was pronounced deceased. Another worker named Paul Martin was also taken to the hospital due to his thumb being cut off in the incident. TNA released a statement regarding the incident the next day through their website. The &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact! was dedicated to &lt;unk&gt;, with a banner at the beginning of the show stating &lt;unk&gt; In memory Kevin &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A moment of silence was held prior to the Impact! &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; in honor of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Several wrestlers were concerned with Kurt Angle &lt;unk&gt;s health going into his &lt;unk&gt; match with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Despite the concerns, Angle appeared to be out of it after the contest but was expected to be &lt;unk&gt;. Samoa &lt;unk&gt;oe and Booker T started a rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship following &lt;unk&gt;. On the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that &lt;unk&gt;oe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that &lt;unk&gt;oe could not beat Booker T in a one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, &lt;unk&gt;oe announced that Booker T and he would face at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; for the title. On the &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed that he did not know which of the two would win at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road, but that he would be there to watch. At the event, &lt;unk&gt;oe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several &lt;unk&gt; and security personnel to try to stop him to no &lt;unk&gt;. He was stopped when Sting &lt;unk&gt; in the contest by bashing &lt;unk&gt;oe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered &lt;unk&gt;oe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T &lt;unk&gt;s legitimate wife &lt;unk&gt;. The match result was ruled a no &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; contest, with &lt;unk&gt;oe retaining the title. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was joined by Christian Cage and &lt;unk&gt; in his feud with Kurt Angle, who was joined by Team &lt;unk&gt;D. &lt;unk&gt; and Angle faced in a &lt;unk&gt; match on the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, which Angle won. Team &lt;unk&gt;D then injured both Cage and &lt;unk&gt; in the narrative, with &lt;unk&gt; being knocked out on the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, while on the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact! Cage was &lt;unk&gt; through a glass table by Brother Ray. &lt;unk&gt; returned from injury on the &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!, challenging Team &lt;unk&gt;D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road, while &lt;unk&gt; at adding Full Metal &lt;unk&gt; rules to the bout. An online poll was held to determine the &lt;unk&gt; for the match, resulting in Full Metal &lt;unk&gt; being chosen. The team of Angle and Team &lt;unk&gt;D were the victors at the event. After &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; went on to captain Team TNA in the &lt;unk&gt; TNA World &lt;unk&gt; Cup Tournament. He competed in a Four Way &lt;unk&gt;ltimate &lt;unk&gt; match at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road as the final round of the tournament. He was unsuccessful in winning the match and gaining the appropriate points to win the tournament, thus causing Team TNA ( &lt;unk&gt;, Alex Shelley, Chris &lt;unk&gt;, and Curry Man &lt;unk&gt; to finish in second place, with Team Mexico ( &lt;unk&gt;, Rey &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ltimo Guerrero, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;r. &lt;unk&gt; being the victors in point rankings. &lt;unk&gt; feuded with &lt;unk&gt;ames Storm and Robert &lt;unk&gt; over the TNA World Tag Team Championship after &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and Storm formed a team known as Beer Money Incorporated and challenged &lt;unk&gt; for the title on the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!. The match was originally won by &lt;unk&gt; and Storm before being &lt;unk&gt; due to interference. &lt;unk&gt; won the restart to retain the championship. After the bout, &lt;unk&gt; and Storm assaulted &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Guerrero. Management Director &lt;unk&gt;im &lt;unk&gt; scheduled a title defense at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and Storm under &lt;unk&gt; Fan &lt;unk&gt;s Revenge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rules on the &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; episode of Impact!. &lt;unk&gt; were successful in defending the title at &lt;unk&gt;ictory Road. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Results &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; King of the Mountain match  &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt; was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People &lt;unk&gt;s Revolutionary Army ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, during the Rhodesian Bush War. The aircraft involved, a &lt;unk&gt;ickers &lt;unk&gt;iscount named the &lt;unk&gt;, was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s regular scheduled service from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls to the capital Salisbury, via the resort town of &lt;unk&gt;. Soon after Flight &lt;unk&gt; took off, a group of &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a Soviet &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; surface &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air infrared &lt;unk&gt; missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; by an unseen ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the &lt;unk&gt; passengers and four crew, &lt;unk&gt; died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the &lt;unk&gt; survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived. &lt;unk&gt; leader &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt; publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the &lt;unk&gt; in an interview with the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s Today programme the same evening, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of &lt;unk&gt;, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black &lt;unk&gt; supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing &lt;unk&gt;, were immediately suspended by the furious &lt;unk&gt;, with Smith calling &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; monster &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both &lt;unk&gt; and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA &lt;unk&gt;. The attack on &lt;unk&gt; in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. Five months later, in February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; shot down Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt;, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt; led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to &lt;unk&gt; declare independence from the &lt;unk&gt;nited Kingdom on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. The idea of &lt;unk&gt; no independence before majority rule &lt;unk&gt; had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s government was dominated by the country &lt;unk&gt;s white minority, so the unilateral declaration went &lt;unk&gt; internationally. Britain and the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the Chinese &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; aligned Zimbabwe African National &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, mostly comprising &lt;unk&gt;, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA &lt;unk&gt; and adopted aspects of &lt;unk&gt; doctrine, while the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dominated Zimbabwe African People &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nion ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, aligned with Soviet &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People &lt;unk&gt;s Revolutionary Army ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the &lt;unk&gt; Second &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December &lt;unk&gt;, when ZANLA attacked &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency campaign during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, developments overseas caused the conflict &lt;unk&gt;s momentum to shift in the insurgents &lt;unk&gt; favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April &lt;unk&gt; caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith &lt;unk&gt;s administration, and led to Mozambique &lt;unk&gt;s independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with &lt;unk&gt;. Around the same time, Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s other main &lt;unk&gt;, South Africa, adopted a &lt;unk&gt; initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls Conference of August &lt;unk&gt;, Smith and the &lt;unk&gt; leader &lt;unk&gt;oshua &lt;unk&gt; held unsuccessful talks between December &lt;unk&gt; and March &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; announced in October &lt;unk&gt;, during the run &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would &lt;unk&gt; attend conferences as a joint &lt;unk&gt; Patriotic Front &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Smith and non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Reverend &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Chief &lt;unk&gt;eremiah &lt;unk&gt; agreed what became the &lt;unk&gt; Internal Settlement &lt;unk&gt;. This created a joint black &lt;unk&gt; white transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, pursuant to &lt;unk&gt; elections. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were invited to participate, but refused ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dubbed Smith &lt;unk&gt;s black colleagues &lt;unk&gt; the blacksmiths &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; proclaimed &lt;unk&gt; to be &lt;unk&gt; The Year of the People &lt;unk&gt; as the war continued. Officials from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;nited African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas. &lt;unk&gt; also began to target Christian missionaries, &lt;unk&gt; in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at &lt;unk&gt; Mission near the Mozambican border on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control. No country recognised Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s interim administration. Smith again worked to bring &lt;unk&gt; into the government, hoping this would lend it some &lt;unk&gt; domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, he attended secret meetings with &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Zambia ( where &lt;unk&gt; was based &lt;unk&gt;, doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation &lt;unk&gt;. Attempts were made to also involve the &lt;unk&gt; leader Robert &lt;unk&gt;, but &lt;unk&gt; would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, negotiations between Smith and &lt;unk&gt; progressed well and &lt;unk&gt; seemed on the verge of success &lt;unk&gt; by the start of September &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; September, Smith and &lt;unk&gt; revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Incident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Prior threats to Rhodesian air traffic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about &lt;unk&gt;, in the latter stages of the war ; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for &lt;unk&gt; was the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shoulder &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; launched surface &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet &lt;unk&gt;nion from the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s as part of the Warsaw Pact &lt;unk&gt;s materiel support. By September &lt;unk&gt;, there had been &lt;unk&gt; reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia was the country &lt;unk&gt;s national airline, established by the government on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; to succeed Central African Airways, which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at Salisbury Airport, Air Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s flight network during the late &lt;unk&gt;s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of &lt;unk&gt;ohannesburg and Durban. The Flight &lt;unk&gt; aircraft was a &lt;unk&gt;ickers &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt;, a British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing. It was named the &lt;unk&gt; after the river of the same name, which flowed between Lake &lt;unk&gt; and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury. The &lt;unk&gt; was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of &lt;unk&gt;. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas on the northern side of the &lt;unk&gt; ( in Zambia &lt;unk&gt;, the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s choice tourist destinations. The flight on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, Sunday afternoon, from &lt;unk&gt; to Salisbury carried four crew members and &lt;unk&gt; passengers, most of whom were &lt;unk&gt; from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from &lt;unk&gt; Airport on schedule soon after &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Central Africa Time. Flight &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Captain &lt;unk&gt;ohn Hood, a native of &lt;unk&gt; who had gained his commercial pilot licence in &lt;unk&gt;. He had flown &lt;unk&gt; for Air Rhodesia since &lt;unk&gt;, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was &lt;unk&gt; years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air &lt;unk&gt; were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; years old and from &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A group of &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas, armed with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, and fired on the &lt;unk&gt; about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seeking missile hit the plane &lt;unk&gt;s starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines &lt;unk&gt;, creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. &lt;unk&gt; wildly, the &lt;unk&gt; began to descend rapidly. At &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. &lt;unk&gt; We &lt;unk&gt;re going in, &lt;unk&gt; he &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; his passengers to &lt;unk&gt; for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the &lt;unk&gt; Hills, in the bush to the west of &lt;unk&gt;, intending to belly land the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the &lt;unk&gt; hit a previously unseen ditch, &lt;unk&gt; and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks &lt;unk&gt; and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Massacre on the ground &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Of the &lt;unk&gt; people on board, &lt;unk&gt;, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Dr Cecil &lt;unk&gt;, led four others &lt;unk&gt; young &lt;unk&gt; Robert and Shannon &lt;unk&gt;, Mrs Sharon &lt;unk&gt;, and her four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old daughter Tracey &lt;unk&gt; off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water. The other &lt;unk&gt; remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. Three of the &lt;unk&gt; survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army &lt;unk&gt; Anthony Hill, &lt;unk&gt;, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left &lt;unk&gt; passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls ( aged &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The guerrillas, who were armed with AK &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rifles, presented themselves to the &lt;unk&gt; passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water. They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves. They told the passengers to &lt;unk&gt; around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about &lt;unk&gt; square metres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt;. Standing roughly &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; away, the cadres now raised their weapons. &lt;unk&gt; You have taken our land, &lt;unk&gt; one of them said. &lt;unk&gt; Please don &lt;unk&gt;t shoot us! &lt;unk&gt; one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire. Having collected water from the nearby village, &lt;unk&gt; and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. &lt;unk&gt; it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s group to &lt;unk&gt; come here &lt;unk&gt;. The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting &lt;unk&gt; and the others to flee. Hill and the &lt;unk&gt; also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their &lt;unk&gt;, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt;. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; around the site, filled their arms with various passengers &lt;unk&gt; belongings, then left again. The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to &lt;unk&gt; Hospital, while &lt;unk&gt; and his group were &lt;unk&gt; to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC &lt;unk&gt;s Today radio programme the next day, laughing as he did so, to the horror of most Rhodesian observers, both black and white. He said that he had received intelligence that the &lt;unk&gt; was being used for military purposes. &lt;unk&gt; said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party &lt;unk&gt;s policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground ; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s general manager, called a &lt;unk&gt; downright, deliberate lie &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was implying that responsibility for the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guerrillas, more specifically the mixed race &lt;unk&gt; Scouts unit, which had often been accused of &lt;unk&gt; rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. &lt;unk&gt; asserts that the massacre &lt;unk&gt; cannot be put beyond &lt;unk&gt; the Scouts, and also supports &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s claim that the &lt;unk&gt; had been used militarily, suggesting that &lt;unk&gt; might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown &lt;unk&gt; ferrying paratroopers for the job, &lt;unk&gt; he writes, &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Falls &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reactions &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; White &lt;unk&gt; turn against blacks &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as &lt;unk&gt; a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most &lt;unk&gt; of Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; seem true. &lt;unk&gt; Indeed, the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with &lt;unk&gt;, and many turned their minds to exacting &lt;unk&gt; for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism. The prominent Indian &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt; family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days &lt;unk&gt; investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the &lt;unk&gt; degree of anger... &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; difficult to control &lt;unk&gt;. White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the &lt;unk&gt; had raped the female passengers before &lt;unk&gt; them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of &lt;unk&gt; to anybody who would either kill &lt;unk&gt; or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial. Geoffrey &lt;unk&gt;, who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became &lt;unk&gt; and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be &lt;unk&gt; terrorist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Describing the Herald &lt;unk&gt; the night of the incident, he relates a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; collective temper &lt;unk&gt; among the white sub &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; editors : &lt;unk&gt; They cursed until their voices became &lt;unk&gt;, threatening dire consequences for all &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt;... I &lt;unk&gt; that some of the more derogatory remarks made in &lt;unk&gt; loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears. &lt;unk&gt; Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days. According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an &lt;unk&gt; Salisbury bar &lt;unk&gt; fingering the &lt;unk&gt; of rifles &lt;unk&gt; and forced blacks drinking there to leave. Time also reported a &lt;unk&gt; that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. Smith says that several would &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; be &lt;unk&gt; groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to &lt;unk&gt; make the local people pay for their crime of &lt;unk&gt; and assisting the terrorists &lt;unk&gt;. He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme &lt;unk&gt;, and that it would not do to attack them. Many &lt;unk&gt; also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Memorial service, &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At a memorial service held on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; for Flight &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s passengers and crew at Salisbury &lt;unk&gt;s Anglican Cathedral, about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people crowded inside, with another &lt;unk&gt; standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. &lt;unk&gt; among those present in the cathedral were &lt;unk&gt; Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including P K van der &lt;unk&gt;, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dean &lt;unk&gt;ohn de Costa gave a sermon &lt;unk&gt; what he described as a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; silence &lt;unk&gt; from overseas. &lt;unk&gt; Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but &lt;unk&gt; at the events attending the &lt;unk&gt;iscount, &lt;unk&gt; he said. &lt;unk&gt; But are we &lt;unk&gt; with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves &lt;unk&gt;? We are not! Like men in the story of the Good &lt;unk&gt;, they pass by on the other side... The &lt;unk&gt; of this ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; flight from &lt;unk&gt; will be burnt upon our memories for years to come. For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Smith &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; talks halted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The talks between Smith and the &lt;unk&gt; leader that had been progressing so &lt;unk&gt; were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; monster &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; comments that the ending of the Smith &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; talks at this time was &lt;unk&gt; potentially the most serious result of the &lt;unk&gt;iscount massacre &lt;unk&gt;, as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He &lt;unk&gt; that an agreement between the two &lt;unk&gt; at this critical stage &lt;unk&gt; might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On &lt;unk&gt; September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s intent to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism &lt;unk&gt;, and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for &lt;unk&gt; any defensive strikes we might undertake &lt;unk&gt; against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the &lt;unk&gt;nited States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt; w &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; not let these &lt;unk&gt; go &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesia strikes back &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt; ; Rhodesia hits New &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Because &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; were based in Zambia, many &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around &lt;unk&gt; in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November &lt;unk&gt; during Operation &lt;unk&gt;, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called &lt;unk&gt; New &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ground assault called Operation &lt;unk&gt;, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA &lt;unk&gt;s aid in the form of nine Soviet &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; made T &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; tanks and four Russian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were &lt;unk&gt; several hundred &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt; ; the &lt;unk&gt; Green Leader &lt;unk&gt; raid &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesia then attacked &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Bowyer later described as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; time &lt;unk&gt; for Flight &lt;unk&gt;. Operation &lt;unk&gt;, launched on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, was another joint &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s primary target, just &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; miles &lt;unk&gt; north &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; east of central &lt;unk&gt;, was the formerly white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; owned &lt;unk&gt; Farm, which had been transformed into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s main headquarters and training base under the name &lt;unk&gt; Freedom Camp &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; presumed that Rhodesia would never &lt;unk&gt; to attack a site so close to &lt;unk&gt;. About &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior &lt;unk&gt; staff also on site. The Rhodesian operation &lt;unk&gt;s other targets were &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; miles &lt;unk&gt; north of &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. &lt;unk&gt; targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked. &lt;unk&gt; by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to &lt;unk&gt; Airport tower as &lt;unk&gt; Green Leader &lt;unk&gt;, a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding &lt;unk&gt; radar &lt;unk&gt; and took control of the country &lt;unk&gt;s airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on &lt;unk&gt; Farm, informing &lt;unk&gt; tower that the attack was against &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia &lt;unk&gt;, and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; all of Green Leader &lt;unk&gt;s instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. &lt;unk&gt;sing &lt;unk&gt; airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors. Historians Paul &lt;unk&gt; and Peter &lt;unk&gt; write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number of guerrillas killed, as most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s army, then numbering about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been &lt;unk&gt; impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young &lt;unk&gt; recruits. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; describes Freedom Camp as &lt;unk&gt; a refugee camp for boys &lt;unk&gt;, and says &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; boys and girls &lt;unk&gt; were killed. He claims that the Red Cross and the &lt;unk&gt;N &lt;unk&gt; Agency &lt;unk&gt; confirmed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s claim that Smith &lt;unk&gt;s forces struck at &lt;unk&gt;, civilian &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Aftermath &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and &lt;unk&gt; bases did much to restore white morale following the &lt;unk&gt;iscount incident, though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; President Kenneth &lt;unk&gt; all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia &lt;unk&gt;s rural areas, and covered three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; quarters of the country by the end of &lt;unk&gt;. Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shielding for its &lt;unk&gt;. Before this work was completed, &lt;unk&gt; shot down a second &lt;unk&gt;iscount, Air Rhodesia Flight &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. This time there were no survivors. Following the second &lt;unk&gt;, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the &lt;unk&gt; would be coated with low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; radiation paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently &lt;unk&gt;. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a &lt;unk&gt;iscount so treated could not be detected by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s targeting system once it was over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; feet ( &lt;unk&gt; m &lt;unk&gt;. There were no further &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; in Rhodesia. In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, majority &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ruled state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December &lt;unk&gt; the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the &lt;unk&gt;K government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status. The &lt;unk&gt;K government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period. Fresh elections were won by &lt;unk&gt;, who took power in April &lt;unk&gt;, concurrently with the country &lt;unk&gt;s recognised independence as Zimbabwe. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy and memorial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In modern Zimbabwe, it is not the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; but rather the &lt;unk&gt; Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory. State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the Herald newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces &lt;unk&gt; and deliberately &lt;unk&gt; thousands of helpless refugees during such operations. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board. The massacre of surviving Flight &lt;unk&gt; passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than &lt;unk&gt; ; in his &lt;unk&gt; memoirs &lt;unk&gt; repeated his claim that &lt;unk&gt; fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that &lt;unk&gt; I truly have no idea how the ten died &lt;unk&gt;. A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on &lt;unk&gt; was built in Zambia in &lt;unk&gt;, and dedicated jointly by the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; governments. A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian &lt;unk&gt;iscount incidents, dubbed the &lt;unk&gt;iscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the &lt;unk&gt; Monument in &lt;unk&gt;, South Africa in &lt;unk&gt;, and inaugurated on &lt;unk&gt; September that year. The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft. A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag. A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;iscount attacks and &lt;unk&gt; the victims on the anniversary of the second &lt;unk&gt; prompted &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; press, with the Herald branding it a racist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; motion &lt;unk&gt; intended to &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; administration and its supporters. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a former &lt;unk&gt; commander, described the move as a &lt;unk&gt; motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher &lt;unk&gt;, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s proposed commemoration &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt;... &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s official response to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s motion included the assertion that in all conflicts &lt;unk&gt; civilians get caught up in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors &lt;unk&gt;, and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the &lt;unk&gt;iscount &lt;unk&gt; with those killed at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Newspaper and journal articles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ’ al in modern &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the ruins of an ancient city found in a &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a gum &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, reported the ruins to La &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; newspaper, which named the site &lt;unk&gt;. After the Berlin Academy of Sciences &lt;unk&gt; magazine republished the report in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and treasure hunters began visiting the forest. Today tourism to the site may help protect the &lt;unk&gt;. It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Columbian Maya civilization. It is located in the archaeological region of the &lt;unk&gt; Basin in what is now northern Guatemala. Situated in the department of El &lt;unk&gt;, the site is part of Guatemala &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; National Park and in &lt;unk&gt; it was declared a &lt;unk&gt;NESCO World Heritage Site. &lt;unk&gt; was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya. Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the &lt;unk&gt;th century BC, &lt;unk&gt; reached its &lt;unk&gt; during the Classic Period, c. &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; AD. During this time, the city dominated much of the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, while interacting with areas throughout &lt;unk&gt; such as the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the distant &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico. There is evidence that &lt;unk&gt; was conquered by &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD. Following the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built at &lt;unk&gt; and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned. These events were coupled with a gradual population decline, culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities, with a long dynastic ruler list, the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments, temples and palaces. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Etymology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The name &lt;unk&gt; may be derived from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; Maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning &lt;unk&gt; at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The name was apparently applied to one of the site &lt;unk&gt;s ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers in the region. It has alternatively been interpreted as meaning &lt;unk&gt; the place of the voices &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt; Maya language. &lt;unk&gt;, however, is not the ancient name for the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery in the &lt;unk&gt;s. &lt;unk&gt; inscriptions at the ruins refer to the ancient city as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, meaning &lt;unk&gt; First &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; may have come to have been called this because &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers of the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name. The kingdom as a whole was simply called &lt;unk&gt;, which is the reading of the &lt;unk&gt; hair bundle &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph seen in the accompanying photo. Its precise meaning remains obscure. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Location &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa &lt;unk&gt;, approximately &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; by road to the southwest. &lt;unk&gt; is approximately &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; north of Guatemala City. It is &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; south of the contemporary Maya city of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of &lt;unk&gt;. The city was located &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; southeast of its great Classic Period rival, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ally &lt;unk&gt;, now in Belize. The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; that included about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; structures. The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands. The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised &lt;unk&gt; spanning the swamps. The area around &lt;unk&gt; has been declared as the &lt;unk&gt; National Park and the preserved area covers &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. The ruins lie among the tropical rainforests of northern Guatemala that formed the &lt;unk&gt; of lowland Maya civilization. The city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils, and may have dominated a natural east &lt;unk&gt; west trade route across the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula. &lt;unk&gt; trees at the &lt;unk&gt; park include gigantic &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the sacred tree of the Maya ; tropical cedar ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and Honduras mahogany ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Regarding the fauna, &lt;unk&gt;, white &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, gray foxes, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s spider monkeys, &lt;unk&gt; monkeys, &lt;unk&gt; eagles, falcons, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, green parrots and &lt;unk&gt; ants can be seen there regularly. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and cougars are also said to &lt;unk&gt; in the park. For centuries this city was completely covered under jungle. The average annual rainfall at &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millimetres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities, &lt;unk&gt; had no water other than what was collected from &lt;unk&gt; and stored in ten reservoirs. Archaeologists working in &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt;th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use. The &lt;unk&gt; National Park covers an area of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. It was created on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; under the auspices of the &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Population &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Population estimates for &lt;unk&gt; vary from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to as high as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inhabitants, with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range. The population of &lt;unk&gt; began a continuous curve of growth starting in the &lt;unk&gt; Period ( approximately &lt;unk&gt; BC &lt;unk&gt; AD &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD &lt;unk&gt; through to &lt;unk&gt;, followed by a sharp decline. For the &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; area falling within the &lt;unk&gt; defenses of the hinterland, the peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. In an area within a &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; radius of the site core, peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; population density is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. In a region within a &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; radius of the site core and including some satellite sites, peak population is estimated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; with a density of &lt;unk&gt; per square kilometer ( &lt;unk&gt; per square mile &lt;unk&gt;. These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive &lt;unk&gt; that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture. However, some archaeologists, such as David Webster, believe these figures to be far too high. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rulers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The dynastic line of &lt;unk&gt;, founded as early as the &lt;unk&gt;st century AD, spanned &lt;unk&gt; years and included at least &lt;unk&gt; rulers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as &lt;unk&gt; BC, in the Middle &lt;unk&gt;. A &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; ceramics dating from about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; BC were found in a sealed &lt;unk&gt;, a subterranean bottle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shaped chamber. Major construction at &lt;unk&gt; was already taking place in the Late &lt;unk&gt; period, first appearing around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still &lt;unk&gt; by sites further north such as El &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. At this time, &lt;unk&gt; participated in the widespread &lt;unk&gt; culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time &lt;unk&gt; a region that included the entire &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize. Two temples dating to Late &lt;unk&gt; times had masonry &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; walled &lt;unk&gt; that may have been &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; vaulted, although this has not been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a &lt;unk&gt; background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red. In the &lt;unk&gt;st century AD rich burials first appeared and &lt;unk&gt; underwent a political and cultural &lt;unk&gt; as its giant northern neighbors declined. At the end of the Late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence &lt;unk&gt;, as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the &lt;unk&gt; and early murals at the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at &lt;unk&gt;. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty was founded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, perhaps in the &lt;unk&gt;rd century AD. At the beginning of the Early Classic, power in the Maya region was concentrated at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, in the core of the Maya &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; may have benefited from the collapse of the large &lt;unk&gt; states such as El &lt;unk&gt;. In the Early Classic &lt;unk&gt; rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region, &lt;unk&gt; the development of other nearby Maya cities. The site, however, was often at war and inscriptions tell of &lt;unk&gt; and conflict with other Maya states, including &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by &lt;unk&gt;, which rose to take &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands. The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between &lt;unk&gt; and its neighbor &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; recording the capture of prisoners from &lt;unk&gt;. There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD &lt;unk&gt;, when Lady &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; conducted a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending ceremony, apparently as queen of the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The fourteenth king of &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak ( Great &lt;unk&gt;aguar &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak except that he was killed on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; AD. On the same day, &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ ( Fire Is Born &lt;unk&gt; arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of &lt;unk&gt;, on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary. On Stela &lt;unk&gt; he is named as &lt;unk&gt; Lord of the West &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Maya &lt;unk&gt; of a &lt;unk&gt; combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the distant &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; Owl may even have been the ruler of &lt;unk&gt;. These recorded events strongly suggest that &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’ led a &lt;unk&gt; invasion that defeated the native &lt;unk&gt; king, who was captured and immediately executed. &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at &lt;unk&gt; itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of &lt;unk&gt; natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including &lt;unk&gt;, where he became king, but did not take the throne of &lt;unk&gt; for himself. Within a year, the son of &lt;unk&gt; Owl by the name of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I ( First Crocodile &lt;unk&gt; had been installed as the tenth king of &lt;unk&gt; while he was still a boy, being enthroned on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. He reigned for &lt;unk&gt; years as king of &lt;unk&gt;, and remained a vassal of &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I took a wife from the &lt;unk&gt;, defeated, &lt;unk&gt; dynasty and thus &lt;unk&gt; the right to rule of his son, &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a small site &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northeast of &lt;unk&gt;, was conquered by the latter during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I. The site became an outpost of &lt;unk&gt;, shielding it from hostile cities further north, and also became a trade link to the Caribbean. Although the new rulers of &lt;unk&gt; were foreign, their descendants were rapidly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; became the key ally and trading partner of &lt;unk&gt; in the Maya lowlands. After being conquered by &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; rapidly dominated the northern and eastern &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, together with smaller towns in the region, were absorbed into &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s kingdom. Other sites, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; de San &lt;unk&gt;os&lt;unk&gt; near Lake &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north. By the middle of the &lt;unk&gt;th century &lt;unk&gt; had a core territory of at least &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; in every direction. Around the &lt;unk&gt;th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s hinterland, joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of &lt;unk&gt; lying to the east and west of the city. Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south. These defenses protected &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s core population and agricultural resources, &lt;unk&gt; an area of approximately &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;. Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the &lt;unk&gt;th century the power of the city reached as far south as &lt;unk&gt;, whose founder K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; was clearly connected with &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; itself was not in an ethnically Maya region and the founding of the &lt;unk&gt; dynasty probably involved the direct intervention of &lt;unk&gt;. K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; arrived in &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt; and bone analysis of his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth at &lt;unk&gt;. An individual known as &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; ( lord K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mo &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is referred to in an early text at &lt;unk&gt; and may well be the same person. His tomb had &lt;unk&gt; characteristics and he was depicted in later portraits dressed in the warrior &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; texts refer to him as &lt;unk&gt; Lord of the West &lt;unk&gt;, much like &lt;unk&gt; K ’ &lt;unk&gt; ’. At the same time, in late &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; founded the nearby site of &lt;unk&gt;, possibly sponsored by &lt;unk&gt; itself. The founding of these two centers may have been part of an effort to impose &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s authority upon the southeastern portion of the Maya region. The interaction between these sites and &lt;unk&gt; was intense over the next three centuries. A long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running rivalry between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; began in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against each other in what has been likened to a long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running war between two Maya &lt;unk&gt;. The kings of these two capitals adopted the title &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to &lt;unk&gt; high king &lt;unk&gt;. The early &lt;unk&gt;th century saw another queen ruling the city, known only as the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was very likely a daughter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak II. She seems never to have ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rulers. The first of these was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;, who seems to have had a long career as a general at &lt;unk&gt; before becoming co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ruler and &lt;unk&gt;th in the dynastic sequence. The Lady of &lt;unk&gt; herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering. It appears she was later paired with lord &lt;unk&gt; Bird Claw &lt;unk&gt;, who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown &lt;unk&gt;th ruler.. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Late Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hiatus &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the mid &lt;unk&gt;th century, &lt;unk&gt; seems to have allied with &lt;unk&gt; and defeated &lt;unk&gt;, closing the Early Classic. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; hiatus &lt;unk&gt; refers to a period between the late &lt;unk&gt;th to late &lt;unk&gt;th century where there was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale construction at &lt;unk&gt;. In the latter half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, a serious crisis &lt;unk&gt; the city, with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture. This hiatus in activity at &lt;unk&gt; was long unexplained until later &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; identified that the period was prompted by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s comprehensive defeat at the hands of &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; polity in AD &lt;unk&gt;, a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of &lt;unk&gt;. The badly eroded Altar &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; described how &lt;unk&gt; suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war in April &lt;unk&gt;. It seems that &lt;unk&gt; was an ally of &lt;unk&gt; in the wider conflict between that city and &lt;unk&gt;, with the defeat of &lt;unk&gt; having a lasting impact upon the city. &lt;unk&gt; was not sacked but its power and influence were broken. After its great victory, &lt;unk&gt; grew rapidly and some of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population may have been forcibly relocated there. During the hiatus period, at least one ruler of &lt;unk&gt; took refuge with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Palenque, another of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s victims. &lt;unk&gt; itself &lt;unk&gt; during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s long hiatus period. The beginning of the &lt;unk&gt; hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly &lt;unk&gt; the Classic period of &lt;unk&gt; chronology into the Early and Late Classic. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; founded &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the southwest, as a military outpost in order to control trade along the course of the &lt;unk&gt; River. B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was installed on the throne of the new outpost at the age of four, in &lt;unk&gt;, and for many years served as a loyal vassal fighting for his brother, the king of &lt;unk&gt;. Roughly twenty years later &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was attacked by &lt;unk&gt; and was soundly defeated. B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was captured by the king of &lt;unk&gt; but, instead of being sacrificed, he was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; instated on his throne as a vassal of his former enemy, and attacked &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, forcing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chaak, the then king of &lt;unk&gt;, to temporarily abandon the city. The first two rulers of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; continued to use the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph of &lt;unk&gt;, and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne of &lt;unk&gt; itself. For some reason, B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil was not installed as the new ruler of &lt;unk&gt; ; instead he stayed at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, driving B &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil into an exile that lasted five years. &lt;unk&gt; tried to encircle &lt;unk&gt; within an area dominated by its allies, such as El Peru, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I erected the first dated monument at &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; years and claimed the title of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on &lt;unk&gt; when, in &lt;unk&gt;, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, &lt;unk&gt; never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, there was no active &lt;unk&gt; presence at any Maya site and the center of &lt;unk&gt; had been razed by &lt;unk&gt;. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was &lt;unk&gt; style. &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I and his heir &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil continued hostilities against &lt;unk&gt; and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around &lt;unk&gt;, extending as far as the territory around Lake &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, a vassal of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s key ally in the south, switched allegiance to &lt;unk&gt;, defeated &lt;unk&gt; and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of &lt;unk&gt; to bring about the collapse of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of &lt;unk&gt;. In the &lt;unk&gt;th century, the rulers of &lt;unk&gt; collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late &lt;unk&gt;th century and early &lt;unk&gt;th century, activity at &lt;unk&gt; slowed. &lt;unk&gt; architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Terminal Classic &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the &lt;unk&gt;th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations &lt;unk&gt; and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, the last of the city &lt;unk&gt;s major pyramids and the erection of monuments to mark the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. The beginning of the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; passed &lt;unk&gt;, and marks the beginning of a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph, with &lt;unk&gt; apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt;awiil is mentioned on a stela at &lt;unk&gt; as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of &lt;unk&gt; but he is not recorded elsewhere and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s once great power was little more than a memory. The sites of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; had by now inherited the once exclusive &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph. As &lt;unk&gt; and its hinterland reached peak population, the area suffered &lt;unk&gt;, erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels. &lt;unk&gt; and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from &lt;unk&gt; that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the &lt;unk&gt; region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources. In the latter half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much diminished city of &lt;unk&gt;, as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II in &lt;unk&gt;. This was the last monument erected at &lt;unk&gt; before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of &lt;unk&gt;, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, did not last much longer, &lt;unk&gt; their final monuments in &lt;unk&gt;. By the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th century the vast majority of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple &lt;unk&gt; dwellings were being erected in the city &lt;unk&gt;s ceremonial &lt;unk&gt;. The squatters blocked some &lt;unk&gt; in the rooms they &lt;unk&gt; in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were &lt;unk&gt; and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for &lt;unk&gt; and the easier to find tombs being looted. After &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the &lt;unk&gt;th or &lt;unk&gt;th centuries and the &lt;unk&gt; claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s population may have migrated to the &lt;unk&gt; Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a &lt;unk&gt; in population levels in the first half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. The most likely cause of collapse at &lt;unk&gt; is &lt;unk&gt; and agrarian failure. The fall of &lt;unk&gt; was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having been at the forefront of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt; reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Modern history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the Spanish &lt;unk&gt; Hern&lt;unk&gt;n Cort&lt;unk&gt;s passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of &lt;unk&gt; but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; became lost in the &lt;unk&gt; forests in early &lt;unk&gt; he described a ruin that may well have been &lt;unk&gt;. As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never &lt;unk&gt; about &lt;unk&gt; and they guided &lt;unk&gt; expeditions to the ruins in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Some second- or third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand accounts of &lt;unk&gt; appeared in print starting in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, continuing through the writings of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Lloyd Stephens in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century ( Stephens and his illustrator Frederick &lt;unk&gt; heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; travels in the region &lt;unk&gt;. Because of the site &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; from modern towns, however, no explorers visited &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, respectively the commissioner and the governor of &lt;unk&gt;, visited it in &lt;unk&gt;. Artist &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in &lt;unk&gt;. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;th century ( including Alfred P. &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. &lt;unk&gt; archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt;, a small airstrip was built at the ruins, which previously could only be reached by several days &lt;unk&gt; travel through the jungle on foot or mule. In &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area. From &lt;unk&gt; through &lt;unk&gt;, major archaeological excavations were carried out by the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania &lt;unk&gt; Project. They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures. Excavations directed by Edwin M. &lt;unk&gt; and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Project recorded over &lt;unk&gt; monuments at the site. In &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; government began a further archeological project at &lt;unk&gt;, which continued through to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; George Lucas used &lt;unk&gt; as a filming location for the first Star Wars film, Episode I&lt;unk&gt; : A New Hope, released in &lt;unk&gt;. Temple I at &lt;unk&gt; was featured on the reverse of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park. A site museum has been built at &lt;unk&gt; ; it was completed in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Site description &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been partially restored by the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala. It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas. The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high, large royal palaces, in addition to a number of smaller pyramids, palaces, residences, administrative buildings, platforms and inscribed stone monuments. There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail, originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors. There are also seven courts for playing the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, including a set of &lt;unk&gt; in the Seven Temples Plaza, a unique feature in &lt;unk&gt;. The limestone used for construction was local and &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; site. The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to &lt;unk&gt; them and were used as reservoirs, together with some &lt;unk&gt; natural depressions. The main &lt;unk&gt; were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that &lt;unk&gt; rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs. The residential area of &lt;unk&gt; covers an estimated &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt;, much of which has not yet been cleared, mapped, or excavated. A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. &lt;unk&gt; and Donald &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;s rings &lt;unk&gt; with a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; metre ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; wide trench behind a rampart. The &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some &lt;unk&gt; square kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; sq mi &lt;unk&gt; ( see below &lt;unk&gt;. Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and possibly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the surrounding area. Recently, a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is &lt;unk&gt; as a defensive feature. In addition, some parts of the &lt;unk&gt; were integrated into a canal system. The &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and &lt;unk&gt; than originally thought. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; By the Late Classic, a network of &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; linked various parts of the city, running for several kilometres through its urban core. These linked the Great Plaza with Temple &lt;unk&gt; ( located about &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; to the west &lt;unk&gt; and the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt; ( about &lt;unk&gt; kilometre ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; to the southeast &lt;unk&gt;. These broad &lt;unk&gt; were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams. The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northeast from Temple I&lt;unk&gt; to Group H. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs southeast from the East Plaza to Temple &lt;unk&gt;I, a distance of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Causeway runs west from the Great Plaza to Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Architectural groups &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramids. On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis. The Central Acropolis is a palace complex just south of the Great Plaza. The North Acropolis, together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south, is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the &lt;unk&gt; Project excavated a massive trench across the complex, thoroughly investigating its construction history. It is a complex group with construction beginning in the &lt;unk&gt; Period, around &lt;unk&gt; BC. It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period, with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures. After AD &lt;unk&gt; a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform, which measured &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;, gradually hiding it from view. Eight temple pyramids were built in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, each of them had an elaborate &lt;unk&gt; and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods. By the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, &lt;unk&gt; stelae and &lt;unk&gt; altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; &lt;unk&gt; of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits. The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the &lt;unk&gt; Period. The South Acropolis is found next to Temple &lt;unk&gt;. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; square metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft &lt;unk&gt;. The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis. It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples, by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; is to the west of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It is the largest ceremonial complex dating from the &lt;unk&gt; period at &lt;unk&gt;. The complex was organized as a large E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Group consisting of a pyramid aligned with a platform to the east that supported three temples. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex was rebuilt many times over the course of its history. By AD &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; its architectural style was influenced by the great metropolis of &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;alley of Mexico, including the use of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; form. During the Early Classic period ( c. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the Mundo &lt;unk&gt; became one of the twin &lt;unk&gt; of the city, the other being the North Acropolis. From AD &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; it may have served as the royal necropolis. The Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex was given its name by the archaeologists of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania ; it is centered upon the Lost World Pyramid and a small platform to the west of it. Group G lies just south of the &lt;unk&gt; Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at &lt;unk&gt;. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of &lt;unk&gt; vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask. Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza. It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic. There are nine Twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pyramid &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;, one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed. They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east &lt;unk&gt; west axis. These pyramids are flat &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; topped and have &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides. A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids, and lying roughly &lt;unk&gt; from them, there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair. On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine &lt;unk&gt;. The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year ( or k &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; intervals during the Late Classic. The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century in the East Plaza. It was once thought that these complexes were unique to &lt;unk&gt; but rare examples have now been found at other sites, such as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and they may reflect the extent of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s political dominance in the Late Classic. Group &lt;unk&gt; is a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex, and is one of the largest at &lt;unk&gt;. It was built by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II in &lt;unk&gt; in order to mark the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt;. Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected. Group R is another twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex, dated to &lt;unk&gt;. It is close to the Maler Causeway. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Structures &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; There are thousands of ancient structures at &lt;unk&gt; and only a fraction of these have been excavated, after decades of archaeological work. The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids, labelled Temples I - &lt;unk&gt;I, each of which support a temple structure on their &lt;unk&gt;. Some of these pyramids are over &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; feet &lt;unk&gt; high. They were numbered &lt;unk&gt; during the early survey of the site. It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years. Temple I ( also known as the Temple of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; or Temple of the Great &lt;unk&gt;aguar &lt;unk&gt; is a funerary pyramid dedicated to &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;, who was &lt;unk&gt; in the structure in AD &lt;unk&gt;, the pyramid was completed around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The temple rises &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high. The massive &lt;unk&gt; that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives. The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey &lt;unk&gt; of the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Pennsylvania in &lt;unk&gt;. Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved and rubbed with &lt;unk&gt;, as well as &lt;unk&gt; and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink. The shrine at the summit of the pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the &lt;unk&gt; spanned by wooden &lt;unk&gt; fashioned from multiple beams. The outermost &lt;unk&gt; is plain but the two inner &lt;unk&gt; were carved, some of the beams were removed in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and their location is unknown, while others were taken to museums in Europe. Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask &lt;unk&gt; it was built around AD &lt;unk&gt; and stands &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high. Like other major temples at &lt;unk&gt;, the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the &lt;unk&gt; spanned by wooden &lt;unk&gt;, only the middle of which was carved. The temple was dedicated to the wife of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;, although no tomb was found. The queen &lt;unk&gt;s portrait was carved into the &lt;unk&gt; spanning the doorway of the summit shrine. One of the beams from this &lt;unk&gt; is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt;aguar Priest &lt;unk&gt; was the last of the great pyramids to be built at &lt;unk&gt;. It stood &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof &lt;unk&gt;, possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD &lt;unk&gt;. The temple shrine possesses two chambers. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is the tallest temple &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid at &lt;unk&gt;, measuring &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; marks the reign of &lt;unk&gt; ’ in Chan &lt;unk&gt; ( Ruler B, the son of Ruler A or &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I &lt;unk&gt; and two carved wooden &lt;unk&gt; over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; that corresponds to CE &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the &lt;unk&gt;th century, and as it currently stands is the tallest pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at &lt;unk&gt; may originally have been taller, as may have been one of the structures at El &lt;unk&gt;. Temple &lt;unk&gt; stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler. The temple stands &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high, making it the second tallest structure at &lt;unk&gt; - only Temple I&lt;unk&gt; is taller. The temple has been dated to about AD &lt;unk&gt;, in the Late Classic period, via &lt;unk&gt; analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Temple &lt;unk&gt;I is also known as the Temple of the &lt;unk&gt; and was dedicated in AD &lt;unk&gt;. It is notable for its &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; metre ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high roof &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; comb. &lt;unk&gt; of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; comb. The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is &lt;unk&gt;. Temple &lt;unk&gt; was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I ( known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway. Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; tall. The final version of Temple &lt;unk&gt; was completely dismantled by archaeologists in &lt;unk&gt; in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction. Structure &lt;unk&gt; is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II over the tomb of his father, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; existing twin pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry &lt;unk&gt; and three &lt;unk&gt;, the fourth ( south &lt;unk&gt; side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; platform profile, modified from the original style found at &lt;unk&gt;. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer &lt;unk&gt; with El &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; than with &lt;unk&gt; itself. The vertical &lt;unk&gt; panels are set between sloping &lt;unk&gt; panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping &lt;unk&gt; panels, related to the &lt;unk&gt;enus and star symbols used at &lt;unk&gt;. The roof of the structure was decorated with &lt;unk&gt; although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a &lt;unk&gt; tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Chaak or that of his son &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I, in the later part of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; possesses a clear &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; linked architectural style ; it has &lt;unk&gt;, an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region, and a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fa&lt;unk&gt;ade ; it dates to the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD. It is located near to the Lost World pyramid. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a small &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style platform that dates to about AD &lt;unk&gt;. It had &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure. The Lost World Pyramid ( Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the largest structure in the Mundo &lt;unk&gt; complex. It lies in the southwest portion of &lt;unk&gt; ’ s central core, south of Temple III and west of Temple &lt;unk&gt;. It was decorated with stucco masks of the sun god and dates to the Late &lt;unk&gt; ; this pyramid is part of an enclosed complex of structures that remained intact and un &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; impacted by later building activity at &lt;unk&gt;. By the end of the Late &lt;unk&gt; this pyramid was one of the largest structures in the Maya region. It attained its final form during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak in the &lt;unk&gt;th century AD, in the Early Classic, standing more than &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; high with &lt;unk&gt; on all four sides and a flat top that possibly supported a superstructure built from &lt;unk&gt; materials. Although the plaza later suffered significant alteration, the organization of a group of temples on the east side of this complex &lt;unk&gt; to the layout that defines the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Groups, identified as solar observatories. Structure &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples. It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; motifs. Group &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated. It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks, &lt;unk&gt; murals, relief sculptures and buildings with &lt;unk&gt; characteristics. The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis. The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III. It has two &lt;unk&gt;, with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey, which has been restored. The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows. Complex N lies to the west of the Bat Palace and Temple III. The complex dates to AD &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Altar &lt;unk&gt; is carved with two nobles, one of whom is probably &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman. Altar &lt;unk&gt; was found in Complex N, which lies to the west of Temple III. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is sculpted with a bound captive. It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; y &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala City. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is associated with Stela &lt;unk&gt; and bears the sculpture of a bound captive. It is located in front of Temple &lt;unk&gt;I. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is carved with a captive tied to a &lt;unk&gt;. It is in the northern enclosure of Group &lt;unk&gt;, a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion. Altar &lt;unk&gt; is a plain monument associated with Stela &lt;unk&gt;. The stela &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; altar pair is &lt;unk&gt; located at the base of the stairway of Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At &lt;unk&gt;, beams of &lt;unk&gt; wood were placed as &lt;unk&gt; spanning the inner &lt;unk&gt; of temples. These are the most elaborately carved wooden &lt;unk&gt; to have survived anywhere in the Maya region. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; from Temple I&lt;unk&gt; was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the &lt;unk&gt;th century. It was in almost perfect condition and depicts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil seated on a &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stelae &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Stelae are carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. A selection of the most notable stelae at &lt;unk&gt; follows : Stela &lt;unk&gt; dates to the &lt;unk&gt;th century and depicts the king &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II in a standing position. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is dated to AD &lt;unk&gt;, during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; after the intrusion of &lt;unk&gt; in the Maya area. The stela displays a mix of Maya and &lt;unk&gt; qualities, and deities from both cultures. It has a portrait of the king with the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;aguar God under one arm and the Mexican &lt;unk&gt; under the other. His helmet is a simplified version of the &lt;unk&gt; War &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nusually for Maya sculpture, but typically for &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is depicted with a frontal face, rather than in profile. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a badly damaged monument dating to &lt;unk&gt; and bears the name of the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; who celebrated the end of the &lt;unk&gt;th K &lt;unk&gt; in that year. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is twinned with Stela &lt;unk&gt; but is badly damaged. It described the accession of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt; in the early &lt;unk&gt;th century and earlier events in his career, including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was the last monument ever erected at &lt;unk&gt; ; it was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is linked to the queen known as the &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and king &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; B &lt;unk&gt;. The queen is described as performing the year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt;, during the reign of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. The sculpture, including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text, are limited to the front face of the monument. It was found in Complex N, west of Temple III. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was one of two stelae erected by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; I to celebrate the k &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending of AD &lt;unk&gt;. It was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected at the base of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, his funerary shrine. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was found in Complex P, in Group H, and was moved to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; y &lt;unk&gt; in Guatemala City. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;in Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil. Only the bottom of the stela is intact, the rest having been &lt;unk&gt; in ancient times. The surviving sculpture is of fine quality, consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text. The stela is associated with Altar &lt;unk&gt; and is located in front of Temple &lt;unk&gt;I. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was dedicated in &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; II in the northern enclosure of Group &lt;unk&gt;, a twin &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pyramid complex. The face of the figure on the stela has been &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was broken in antiquity and was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; erected in a residential complex. The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; Lady of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a daughter of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right, being paired with male co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; rulers. It dates to the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was erected at the foot of Temple &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, accompanied by Altar &lt;unk&gt;. Both were broken into fragments in ancient times, although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments. Stela &lt;unk&gt; was found in the summit shrine of Temple &lt;unk&gt;, underneath a broken masonry altar. The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken, probably at the beginning of the Late Classic. Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine. Stela &lt;unk&gt; bears a Long Count ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; date equivalent to AD &lt;unk&gt;, the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands. The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the &lt;unk&gt; emblem glyph. It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right, holding the head of an underworld jaguar god, one of the patron deities of the city. The stela was deliberately smashed during the &lt;unk&gt;th century or some time later, the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III, to be uncovered by archaeologists in &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography is similar to that of &lt;unk&gt;, one of the more important of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s enemies. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is the accession monument of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil II, also bearing two portraits of his father, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as a youth dressed as a &lt;unk&gt; warrior. He carries a &lt;unk&gt; in one hand and bears a shield decorated with the face of &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; buried. Stela &lt;unk&gt; has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at &lt;unk&gt;. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of &lt;unk&gt; K &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at El Peru and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. It was also the first stela at &lt;unk&gt; to be carved on all four faces. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a fragmented monument with a foreign &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god &lt;unk&gt;, including his &lt;unk&gt; eyes and &lt;unk&gt; headdress. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex. The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak, holding a flint axe in his left hand. He is &lt;unk&gt; the figure of a bound, richly dressed captive. The monument is dated to AD &lt;unk&gt;. The text on the back of the monument describes a &lt;unk&gt; ritual to celebrate a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ending. The stela also names &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Ich &lt;unk&gt;aak I &lt;unk&gt;s father as K &lt;unk&gt;inich &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; bears a portrait of Kan &lt;unk&gt; and dates to AD &lt;unk&gt;. Stela &lt;unk&gt; is paired with Altar &lt;unk&gt;. It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple I&lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb, with the handle formed from three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dimensional body painted on the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. It is located beneath Structure &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. The tomb contained a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also &lt;unk&gt; with the deceased king. &lt;unk&gt; in the tomb were &lt;unk&gt; and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and &lt;unk&gt; styles. Among the offerings was an incense &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the shape of an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a &lt;unk&gt; vault, then the pyramid was built on top. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is generally accepted as the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;. It is located beneath Temple &lt;unk&gt; in the North Acropolis. The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two &lt;unk&gt; who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler. The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, probably the date of either the death or interment of the king. The king &lt;unk&gt;s skeleton was missing its skull, its &lt;unk&gt; and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; dates to the Late &lt;unk&gt; and was enclosed by a platform, with a primitive &lt;unk&gt; vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its &lt;unk&gt;. The dynastic founder of &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ook, has been linked to this tomb, which lies deep in the heart of the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being &lt;unk&gt; by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small &lt;unk&gt; mask with shell &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; teeth and eyes and bearing a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pointed royal &lt;unk&gt;. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare &lt;unk&gt; lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a &lt;unk&gt; shell and twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; six ceramic vessels. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is the tomb of &lt;unk&gt; Chan K &lt;unk&gt;awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, below the level of the Great Plaza. The tomb contained rich offerings of &lt;unk&gt;, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of &lt;unk&gt; ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate &lt;unk&gt; mosaic vessel with the &lt;unk&gt; bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was flooded with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely &lt;unk&gt; away by the time the tomb was excavated, leaving &lt;unk&gt; in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these &lt;unk&gt; with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K &lt;unk&gt;awiil, the wooden originals long gone. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a &lt;unk&gt; mosaic vessel topped with the head of the &lt;unk&gt; God.  &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog ( &lt;unk&gt; video game &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. The game was first released in North America, Europe and Australia in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;apan the following month. The game features an anthropomorphic &lt;unk&gt; named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. &lt;unk&gt;, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;s gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button. The game &lt;unk&gt;s development began in &lt;unk&gt;, when Sega ordered its &lt;unk&gt; development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue &lt;unk&gt; with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves &lt;unk&gt; Sonic Team &lt;unk&gt; to match their character. Sonic the Hedgehog, designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s sprite to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a tech demo created by the game &lt;unk&gt;s programmer, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The game was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, music, and speed of gameplay. The game was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super &lt;unk&gt; console. It has been ported a number of times, and inspired several &lt;unk&gt;, a successful franchise, and adaptations by other media. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Plot &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In an attempt to steal the six Chaos &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; their power, the game &lt;unk&gt;s antagonist, Dr. Ivo &lt;unk&gt;, has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the &lt;unk&gt; himself. If the player collects all the Chaos &lt;unk&gt; and completes the game, a reward ending sequence is shown. If all the &lt;unk&gt; are not collected, &lt;unk&gt; taunts the player while &lt;unk&gt; the Chaos &lt;unk&gt; instead. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gameplay &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog is a &lt;unk&gt;D, side &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loops. The levels contain &lt;unk&gt; in the form of robots ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the Western game manuals &lt;unk&gt; inside of which Dr. &lt;unk&gt; has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into &lt;unk&gt; pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s main attack is his spin, where he &lt;unk&gt; into a ball and &lt;unk&gt; rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles &lt;unk&gt;. This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground. &lt;unk&gt; around each level map are gold rings, and collecting &lt;unk&gt; rings rewards the player with an extra life. &lt;unk&gt; are a layer of protection against &lt;unk&gt; ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he &lt;unk&gt; with an enemy ( or obstacle &lt;unk&gt;, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered ; they will &lt;unk&gt; and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary &lt;unk&gt; may be collected to provide additional protection, certain &lt;unk&gt; ( such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a &lt;unk&gt; pit or running out of time &lt;unk&gt; will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection. The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill, &lt;unk&gt;, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and &lt;unk&gt; Brain &lt;unk&gt;, each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts &lt;unk&gt; to progress. At the end of each zone &lt;unk&gt;s third act, the player confronts Dr. &lt;unk&gt; ( who pilots a different vehicle each time &lt;unk&gt; in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with &lt;unk&gt;. The player begins with three lives ( power &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ups and rings add more &lt;unk&gt;, which are lost when Sonic &lt;unk&gt; with hazardous enemies ( or objects &lt;unk&gt; without rings, falls off &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen or exceeds an act &lt;unk&gt;s ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; minute time limit. &lt;unk&gt; acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the &lt;unk&gt; will reset to &lt;unk&gt; : &lt;unk&gt; when he returns to the &lt;unk&gt;. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues &lt;unk&gt;. When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a &lt;unk&gt; Secret Zone &lt;unk&gt; in the original Genesis manual &lt;unk&gt;. In each of six Special &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt; off the &lt;unk&gt; and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each &lt;unk&gt; rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a &lt;unk&gt; goal block &lt;unk&gt; ( which ends the level &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Development &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background and character design &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, Sega ordered its in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; house development studio, &lt;unk&gt;, to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company. This was a position already held by the character Alex &lt;unk&gt;, but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse. Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot, Mario, in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time, particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. &lt;unk&gt;, and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry. Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles, it knew this would not be enough. &lt;unk&gt; developed ideas for characters, an engine, and gameplay mechanics. Development emphasized speed, so &lt;unk&gt; eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals, as well as fast creatures like &lt;unk&gt; and squirrels. One idea, a &lt;unk&gt; able to grasp objects with prehensile ears, showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware. The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball, their idea for an attacking move. &lt;unk&gt; then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough, so they focused on two animals with spikes : &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; character, first proposed by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, prevailed, although the &lt;unk&gt; would later become the basis for Mighty the &lt;unk&gt; ( who first appeared in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; has admitted since that he created Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s basic design by combining Felix the Cat &lt;unk&gt;s head with Mickey Mouse &lt;unk&gt;s body. Sonic was originally &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; colored, then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo. His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael &lt;unk&gt;ackson &lt;unk&gt;s boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus, whom &lt;unk&gt; saw as the most &lt;unk&gt; famous character in the world &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s spikes were emphasized to make him look &lt;unk&gt;, and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button &lt;unk&gt;. The new character was originally named &lt;unk&gt; Mr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but the eight &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; member &lt;unk&gt; changed his name to &lt;unk&gt; Sonic &lt;unk&gt; and their studios to Sonic Team. &lt;unk&gt; proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band, giving him vampire fangs, and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna, but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple. Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a &lt;unk&gt; is and initially proposed a full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale recreation of the character, but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes. The antagonist ended up being named &lt;unk&gt; Dr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan and &lt;unk&gt; Dr. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega &lt;unk&gt;s American and &lt;unk&gt;apanese divisions. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Programming and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With a satisfying protagonist completed, Sega turned to esteemed programmer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who had impressed them through his work on &lt;unk&gt; Star and the Genesis port of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; n &lt;unk&gt;. The gameplay originated with a tech demo by &lt;unk&gt;, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s prototype was a platform game with a fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was &lt;unk&gt; out with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s character designs and levels by designer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was &lt;unk&gt; in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The game &lt;unk&gt;s color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist &lt;unk&gt; Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California. In designing the game mechanics, &lt;unk&gt; was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. &lt;unk&gt; the simplicity of Miyamoto &lt;unk&gt;s mechanics in complex environments, &lt;unk&gt; decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly. Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis &lt;unk&gt; technological prowess, the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign, a process taking over six months. The developers &lt;unk&gt; efforts were rewarded ; according to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the game had the fastest &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console. The team intended to add a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; player mode displayed via split &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; screen, but &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature. However, such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, where the second player would control Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s best friend Miles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; worked &lt;unk&gt; hours a day on the project for several months. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s relationship with Sega of &lt;unk&gt;apan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game. He left the company shortly after the game &lt;unk&gt;s release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega of &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the game &lt;unk&gt;s code. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Music &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato &lt;unk&gt;, bassist and lead songwriter of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pop band Dreams Come True. The game uses &lt;unk&gt; Yamaha &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; programmable sound generators to produce a variety of &lt;unk&gt; sound effects and music. It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic &lt;unk&gt; to the music of a &lt;unk&gt; Sonic Band &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on guitar, Max Monkey on bass, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on drums, and &lt;unk&gt; the Crocodile on keyboard. The playable &lt;unk&gt; became a recurring character in the series, also appearing in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Heroes, and Sonic Free &lt;unk&gt;. The development schedule scrapped the feature, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; replaced the test with the &lt;unk&gt; Se &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;! &lt;unk&gt; chant used in T&lt;unk&gt; commercials ( which reportedly used one &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eighth of the memory of the four &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; cartridge &lt;unk&gt;. On October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, twenty years after the game &lt;unk&gt;s release, a three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; was released in &lt;unk&gt;apan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Masato &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their &lt;unk&gt; remixes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and release &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Game &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; package illustrator Akira &lt;unk&gt; said that his goal was to make the characters &lt;unk&gt; colorful &lt;unk&gt;, using clear lines and &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; finish them &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. According to &lt;unk&gt;, the developers asked him to create a package design &lt;unk&gt; similar to pop art... without being particular to conventional packages &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; something &lt;unk&gt; original &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; stylish &lt;unk&gt;. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt;apan on &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing &lt;unk&gt; Beast. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; versions and ports &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A version of Sonic the Hedgehog was developed by Ancient and released in &lt;unk&gt; for Sega &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit consoles, the Master System and Game &lt;unk&gt;. Its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version, with different level themes and digital assets. The level design is &lt;unk&gt;, with no vertical loops, and Sonic cannot re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; collect his rings after being hit. The game has a different soundtrack, composed by &lt;unk&gt; musician &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and including his compositions and adaptations of music from the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit version. It was the final game released for the Master System in North America. The Master System version was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; released for Wii &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; service in North America on August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and in Europe on August &lt;unk&gt;. The Game &lt;unk&gt; version was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; released for the Nintendo &lt;unk&gt;DS &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and included as an &lt;unk&gt; game in Sonic Adventure &lt;unk&gt; : Director &lt;unk&gt;s Cut for &lt;unk&gt; and Windows and Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PlayStation &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;box, and Windows. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A port, Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis, was released for the Game Boy Advance ( GBA &lt;unk&gt; on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;nited States to mark the game &lt;unk&gt;s fifteenth anniversary. It included several new features, such as the ability to save game progress, a level select option, and an &lt;unk&gt; Mode with the Spin &lt;unk&gt; move ( not originally implemented until Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Its screen is slightly &lt;unk&gt; in, and adapted to the GBA &lt;unk&gt;s widescreen aspect ratio. The game received poor reviews, with a Metacritic score of &lt;unk&gt; percent ; the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance ( resulting in a slow frame rate &lt;unk&gt;, remixed &lt;unk&gt; music, and poor preservation of the original gameplay. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Compilation releases &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; With its sequels for the Genesis, Sonic the Hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers. It has appeared in Sonic Compilation ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Genesis, Sonic &lt;unk&gt;am ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Sega Saturn and &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Mega Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic Mega Collection Plus ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;ltimate Genesis Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt;box &lt;unk&gt; and PlayStation &lt;unk&gt;, and Sonic Classic Collection ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for the Nintendo DS. Additionally, the game is an &lt;unk&gt; reward in the console versions of Sonic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Downloadable releases &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog has been available for all three major seventh &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; generation video game consoles. It was part of the Wii &lt;unk&gt;irtual &lt;unk&gt; at the service &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; introduction, and was released for the &lt;unk&gt;box Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for the &lt;unk&gt; Classic, &lt;unk&gt; video, and video &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; capable &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; models in &lt;unk&gt; and for Apple &lt;unk&gt;s iOS service ( compatible &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; touch models &lt;unk&gt; in April &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic the Hedgehog became available on &lt;unk&gt; in September &lt;unk&gt;. In October &lt;unk&gt;, it was released as a Microsoft Windows download which was ported to Steam. The game was ported to two online &lt;unk&gt; services ( Google Play and the Amazon &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in December &lt;unk&gt;. A remastered mobile port, created using Christian Whitehead &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; Engine previously used in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of Sonic CD, was released on iOS, replacing the original port, on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with an &lt;unk&gt; version released the following day. The port features widescreen graphics, the optional ability to spin dash, a time attack mode, and the &lt;unk&gt; option to play as &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;. The game was also released as part of the Nintendo &lt;unk&gt;DS &lt;unk&gt;D Classics line in May &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;apan, and worldwide in December. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reception &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews, with an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews. The game rivaled the Mario series, particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System &lt;unk&gt;. Paul Rand of Computer and &lt;unk&gt;ideo Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more &lt;unk&gt; depth of play &lt;unk&gt;. Reviewers noted the game &lt;unk&gt;s colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme &lt;unk&gt; lively, but never &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds &lt;unk&gt; eye &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; popping &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; gorgeous &lt;unk&gt;, which was echoed by Mean Machines. According to the &lt;unk&gt; ( Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk &lt;unk&gt; of Dragon, &lt;unk&gt; The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; called the animation &lt;unk&gt; some of the &lt;unk&gt; and fastest... ever seen &lt;unk&gt;. The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them &lt;unk&gt; great &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; amazing &lt;unk&gt;. Rand noted &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of catchy tunes and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, calling some of the sound effects &lt;unk&gt; absolutely brilliant &lt;unk&gt;. Although Mean Machines called the songs &lt;unk&gt; vaguely appealing &lt;unk&gt;, the game &lt;unk&gt;s sound effects were better appreciated. Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in &lt;unk&gt;. GamePro &lt;unk&gt;s Boogie Man noted its &lt;unk&gt; lightning &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fast action &lt;unk&gt; and, according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; If you thought the Enterprise was quick, wait till you see Sonic at &lt;unk&gt; speed. &lt;unk&gt; The game &lt;unk&gt;s difficulty was disputed, described as &lt;unk&gt; impossible &lt;unk&gt; by Rand and &lt;unk&gt; average &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;. Rand said about the gameplay in general that it &lt;unk&gt; plays like a dream &lt;unk&gt; ; according to &lt;unk&gt; it would &lt;unk&gt; players for hours, and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team &lt;unk&gt;s ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping. Although &lt;unk&gt;, Dragon, and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms &lt;unk&gt;, Paul found losing all of one &lt;unk&gt;s rings frustrating. Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity, appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time. Frank &lt;unk&gt; of GameSpot described the game as &lt;unk&gt; one of the best &lt;unk&gt; of all time &lt;unk&gt;, noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port &lt;unk&gt; after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up &lt;unk&gt;. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : &lt;unk&gt; You &lt;unk&gt;ll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic &lt;unk&gt;s graphics engine, which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game &lt;unk&gt;s known for. But the technical achievement impressed back in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and still does so today. &lt;unk&gt; Mega ranked the game its third &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; favorite Genesis title, and in &lt;unk&gt; Game Informer called it the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over &lt;unk&gt; million copies by February &lt;unk&gt;, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Legacy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on the industry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Primarily because of its Genesis &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console &lt;unk&gt;s North American popularity. During October &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, the Genesis &lt;unk&gt; the Super &lt;unk&gt; by a two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; one ratio, and at its &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; peak claimed &lt;unk&gt; percent of the market for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, this was the first time since December &lt;unk&gt; that the company did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and momentum &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based physics to the standard platform formula. Set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pieces and mechanics introduced by the game ( such as loops, springs, and acceleration pads &lt;unk&gt; have appeared in other games and become associated with the Sonic series. A flood of &lt;unk&gt; animal with attitude &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, each featuring a cartoon mascot, were released after Sonic the Hedgehog : &lt;unk&gt;, Aero the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Bat, &lt;unk&gt;ames Pond &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;im, Zero the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; the Tasmanian Tiger, &lt;unk&gt;. This carried into the PlayStation era with games like &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Crash Bandicoot. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and other media &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The game &lt;unk&gt;s success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise. A &lt;unk&gt; sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog &lt;unk&gt;, gave Sonic a best friend ( and sidekick &lt;unk&gt; named Miles &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and continued the fight against Dr. &lt;unk&gt;. Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and &lt;unk&gt; as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the &lt;unk&gt;. The series has ventured from &lt;unk&gt; to fighting, racing, role &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; playing, and sports games, and has expanded into anime and manga, cartoons and comic books, novels, and toys. Sonic the Hedgehog has become one of the best &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; selling video game franchises of all time, with over &lt;unk&gt; million copies sold by May &lt;unk&gt;. The game &lt;unk&gt;s first stage, Green Hill Zone, has also been re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; for use in several other titles such as Sonic Adventure &lt;unk&gt;, Sonic &lt;unk&gt; and the Super Smash Bros. series.  &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. C. W. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was the &lt;unk&gt;th Governor of Kentucky and a &lt;unk&gt;nited States Senator from Kentucky. He was the state &lt;unk&gt;s first popularly elected senator following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment. &lt;unk&gt; from a prominent political family, &lt;unk&gt; was chosen as Democrat William &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s running mate in the gubernatorial election of &lt;unk&gt; despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so. &lt;unk&gt; lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor, but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot &lt;unk&gt;. A day later the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt; enough votes to give the election to &lt;unk&gt;, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and &lt;unk&gt; over the governorship. &lt;unk&gt; ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Following his term as governor, &lt;unk&gt; made a bid to become a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senator. His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley. Six years later &lt;unk&gt; secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; election bid largely because of his pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; temperance views and his opposition to women &lt;unk&gt;s suffrage. Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing in his gubernatorial bid in &lt;unk&gt; and his &lt;unk&gt; campaign in &lt;unk&gt;. He died in Louisville on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early life &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. C. W. &lt;unk&gt; was born at &lt;unk&gt;, near &lt;unk&gt; in Nelson County, Kentucky, son of William &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ulia &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. His maternal grandfather, Charles A. &lt;unk&gt;, was governor of Kentucky from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and served as &lt;unk&gt; general in the administration of &lt;unk&gt;ohn Tyler. His uncle, Robert C. &lt;unk&gt;, served as governor of Louisiana. &lt;unk&gt; obtained his early education at &lt;unk&gt; Academy in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of &lt;unk&gt;. Later, he enrolled at Central &lt;unk&gt;niversity ( now Eastern Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt; in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of &lt;unk&gt; to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of &lt;unk&gt; public schools, serving from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, he studied law at the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in &lt;unk&gt;. He was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. He also served as president of the Young Democrats &lt;unk&gt; Club of Nelson County. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Political career &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s political career began in &lt;unk&gt; when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms and was Speaker of the House in &lt;unk&gt;, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Governor of Kentucky &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Democrat William &lt;unk&gt; chose &lt;unk&gt; as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate. But friends of &lt;unk&gt; assured him that &lt;unk&gt; would be loyal to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s reform agenda, whereas the two other men &lt;unk&gt; was considering as running mates would &lt;unk&gt; stack the Senate committees against him. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was not yet &lt;unk&gt;, the minimum age to serve as governor, at the time of his selection. &lt;unk&gt; lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt;s session opened on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the election results were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, when &lt;unk&gt; was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building. The following day, as &lt;unk&gt; was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly &lt;unk&gt; enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later &lt;unk&gt; died, never having risen from the bed. Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly &lt;unk&gt;s decision and &lt;unk&gt; the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature &lt;unk&gt; Taylor &lt;unk&gt;s orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Taylor and &lt;unk&gt; agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of &lt;unk&gt;. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, at that time the court of last resort in the state. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, which declined to hear the case on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Taylor &lt;unk&gt;s only supporter on the court was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ohn Marshall &lt;unk&gt;. Following the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to Indianapolis, Indiana, fearing he would be implicated in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s assassination. &lt;unk&gt; became acting governor, but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election, a special election was held November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, to determine who would complete &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; term. &lt;unk&gt; ( now of age &lt;unk&gt; won the election over Republican &lt;unk&gt;ohn W. &lt;unk&gt; by fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. Shortly following the special election, &lt;unk&gt; married &lt;unk&gt;ean Raphael &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. The couple had two sons. As governor &lt;unk&gt; sought to unite his party and the state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the &lt;unk&gt; partisan &lt;unk&gt; Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly. He stressed non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state &lt;unk&gt;s educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and &lt;unk&gt; had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state &lt;unk&gt;s revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under &lt;unk&gt; to work without their parents &lt;unk&gt; consent. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second term &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, &lt;unk&gt; announced he would seek a full term as governor in &lt;unk&gt;. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled &lt;unk&gt; had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. &lt;unk&gt;, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. &lt;unk&gt; defeated &lt;unk&gt; and three minor candidates. In his message to the legislature in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the &lt;unk&gt; session. During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; signed the Day Law &lt;unk&gt; racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky. &lt;unk&gt; College, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the &lt;unk&gt;s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. &lt;unk&gt; appealed to the Supreme Court, and in &lt;unk&gt; the court handed down an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; decision against the college. Only &lt;unk&gt;ohn Marshall &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Near the close of the &lt;unk&gt; session, legislators approved the creation of &lt;unk&gt; County from parts of Carter, Elliott, and Lewis counties. Olive Hill was made the county seat. Soon the county &lt;unk&gt;s existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the &lt;unk&gt; square miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than &lt;unk&gt; square miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of &lt;unk&gt; County passed too close to Grayson, the seat of Carter County, and &lt;unk&gt;, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of a county seat. On April &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the &lt;unk&gt; and dissolved &lt;unk&gt; County. During the &lt;unk&gt; legislative session, &lt;unk&gt; urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred &lt;unk&gt;, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, &lt;unk&gt; the its economy and providing &lt;unk&gt; some protection against fraud. &lt;unk&gt; refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black &lt;unk&gt; Tobacco Wars. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably his reasons were political &lt;unk&gt; the Democrats were dominant in this region and he didn &lt;unk&gt;t want to challenge his own party. By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government, &lt;unk&gt; virtually eliminated the state &lt;unk&gt;s debt. Encouraged by the state &lt;unk&gt;s improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state &lt;unk&gt;s normal schools, Western State Teachers College in &lt;unk&gt; Green ( later Western Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt; and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky &lt;unk&gt;niversity &lt;unk&gt;. With a successful legislative session behind him, &lt;unk&gt; made a bold political move in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; : he orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and &lt;unk&gt; primaries in November &lt;unk&gt; a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the &lt;unk&gt; election. &lt;unk&gt; wanted the Senate seat, and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination while he was still governor. It also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party &lt;unk&gt;s choice of his potential successor as governor. State &lt;unk&gt; Samuel Wilbur &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s choice for governor and easily won the early primary over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Former governor &lt;unk&gt;ames B. &lt;unk&gt; challenged &lt;unk&gt; for the &lt;unk&gt; nomination, but &lt;unk&gt; won by more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senator &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s term as governor ended December &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former governor William O. Bradley. On the first ballot &lt;unk&gt; secured &lt;unk&gt; of the needed &lt;unk&gt; votes ; Bradley received &lt;unk&gt; votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for &lt;unk&gt;. Over the next six weeks, &lt;unk&gt; more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority, even though William &lt;unk&gt;ennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for &lt;unk&gt;. Some Democrats pressured &lt;unk&gt; to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the &lt;unk&gt;th ballot, taken near the end of February &lt;unk&gt;, Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ardent support of prohibition likely cost him the election. His position put him at odds with Henry &lt;unk&gt;, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournal. As governor &lt;unk&gt; had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals &lt;unk&gt; the results of Louisville &lt;unk&gt;s municipal elections due to interference by the city &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; whiskey ring &lt;unk&gt; in May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; appointed Robert Worth &lt;unk&gt;, a young lawyer and fellow &lt;unk&gt;, as interim mayor until elections could be held in November. &lt;unk&gt; eliminated &lt;unk&gt; in the police department, closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday. Following this, the whiskey ring announced &lt;unk&gt; had forfeited the support of Louisville &lt;unk&gt;s legislators. In the &lt;unk&gt; election in &lt;unk&gt;, three of the four Democrats who voted against &lt;unk&gt; were from Louisville. Following his defeat, &lt;unk&gt; returned to his law practice. Six years later &lt;unk&gt; again attempted to win the Senate seat. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment, the senator would not be elected by the legislature, but by popular vote. In the Democratic primary &lt;unk&gt; defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year veteran congressman. The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; by his support of President &lt;unk&gt; Wilson, &lt;unk&gt; won the election by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; served as chairman of the Senate Committee on &lt;unk&gt; in the Department of Labor from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky, Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the &lt;unk&gt;nited States &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. When the &lt;unk&gt;nited States entered World War I, &lt;unk&gt; continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations. True to his &lt;unk&gt; stance, &lt;unk&gt; supported passage of the &lt;unk&gt; Amendment &lt;unk&gt; the import and sale of alcohol in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics, &lt;unk&gt; opposed the &lt;unk&gt; Amendment, which granted women &lt;unk&gt;s suffrage. The amendment failed on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, but passed on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; voted against it both times. The Democrats &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; without opposition in &lt;unk&gt;. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the &lt;unk&gt; industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas where these industries were prominent &lt;unk&gt; received more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee &lt;unk&gt;ames M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women &lt;unk&gt;s vote and by his support of President Wilson, who had lost popularity since &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s election in &lt;unk&gt;. Ernst won the election by fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes, winning the race with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent of the vote to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; percent. During his single term in the Senate &lt;unk&gt; served alongside three other &lt;unk&gt;.S. Senators from Kentucky : &lt;unk&gt; M. &lt;unk&gt;ames, George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Later life and death &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following his term in the Senate, &lt;unk&gt; resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in &lt;unk&gt;. This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ournal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. &lt;unk&gt;. He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the &lt;unk&gt; Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow &lt;unk&gt; betting at the state &lt;unk&gt;s horse &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; Club ran a candidate in both parties &lt;unk&gt; primary elections. In the Democratic primary &lt;unk&gt; defeated the Club &lt;unk&gt;s relatively obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. &lt;unk&gt; D. Sampson, the Club &lt;unk&gt;s nominee in the Republican primary, won his party &lt;unk&gt;s nomination. In the general election &lt;unk&gt; could not secure the support of Democratic governor William &lt;unk&gt;. Fields, who had been elected with the help of the &lt;unk&gt; Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, &lt;unk&gt; lost to Sampson by more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. It was estimated that the Club spent over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to defeat him. &lt;unk&gt; was expected to be the Democrats &lt;unk&gt; nominee for governor in &lt;unk&gt;, but the death of his son in late &lt;unk&gt; left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to A. B. &lt;unk&gt; Happy &lt;unk&gt; Chandler of Henderson, who won the election. &lt;unk&gt; supported Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s bid, and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government &lt;unk&gt; Commission. &lt;unk&gt; attempted to return to the Senate in &lt;unk&gt;. The head of the &lt;unk&gt; Club, &lt;unk&gt;ames B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ally, Robert &lt;unk&gt;, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt;s, increasing his prominence and influence. &lt;unk&gt; also enjoyed the support of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, though, by the entry of &lt;unk&gt;ohn &lt;unk&gt; Brown, a Democrat who was a &lt;unk&gt;.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler &lt;unk&gt;s support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to &lt;unk&gt;, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of &lt;unk&gt; and Chandler, he did garner &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes, most of them at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; votes. &lt;unk&gt; died in Louisville on &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. &lt;unk&gt; County, Oklahoma, was named in his honor at the suggestion of a &lt;unk&gt; who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma &lt;unk&gt;s constitutional convention in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;, his birthplace, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Military history of Australia &lt;unk&gt; The military history of Australia spans the nation &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year modern history, from the early Australian frontier wars between &lt;unk&gt; and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early &lt;unk&gt;st century. Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations, Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars, and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity, including the Anzac spirit. The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma. As British &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian colonies participated in Britain &lt;unk&gt;s small wars of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, while later as a &lt;unk&gt; dominion, and then an independent nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, as well as in the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and &lt;unk&gt;ietnam during the Cold War. In the Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, through the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In total, nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians died during the course of these conflicts. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; War and Australian society &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males, and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, it continues to influence Australian society to this day. War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history, while a major part of the national identity has been built on an &lt;unk&gt; conception of the Australian experience of war and of &lt;unk&gt;, known as the Anzac spirit. These ideals include notions of endurance, courage, ingenuity, humour, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ; traits which, according to popular thought, defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War. The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity. The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : &lt;unk&gt; with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the &lt;unk&gt;apanese crisis of &lt;unk&gt;, while since then an alliance with the &lt;unk&gt;nited States has &lt;unk&gt; its security. &lt;unk&gt;, this pattern of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more &lt;unk&gt; security concerns &lt;unk&gt; has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic &lt;unk&gt; has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to &lt;unk&gt; resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in &lt;unk&gt; for major military challenges. Reflecting both the realist and liberal &lt;unk&gt; of international relations and the conception of national interests, a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the &lt;unk&gt; of notions of &lt;unk&gt; sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a &lt;unk&gt; of security, and the proposition that the status &lt;unk&gt; in international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, &lt;unk&gt;, collective security and defence self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic &lt;unk&gt; have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society &lt;unk&gt;s democratic political tradition and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Christian Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These &lt;unk&gt; are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pacific, and the &lt;unk&gt; circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers &lt;unk&gt; known colloquially as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; have often been noted, somewhat &lt;unk&gt;, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Colonial era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British Forces in Australia, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt; the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in &lt;unk&gt; by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in &lt;unk&gt;. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in &lt;unk&gt;. As a result, in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;rd ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever &lt;unk&gt;. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating &lt;unk&gt;, putting down convict rebellions &lt;unk&gt; as occurred at Bathurst in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; on the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian &lt;unk&gt;. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station, based in Sydney. However, in &lt;unk&gt; Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a &lt;unk&gt;, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until &lt;unk&gt;, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy &lt;unk&gt;s depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Frontier warfare, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied, but were inevitably hostile when the settler &lt;unk&gt;s presence led to competition over resources, and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants &lt;unk&gt; lands. European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations, and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation. By and large neither the British nor the &lt;unk&gt; approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare. At times, however, the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units. Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands, while many &lt;unk&gt; served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes. Fighting between &lt;unk&gt; and Europeans was localised as the &lt;unk&gt; did not form &lt;unk&gt; capable of sustained resistance. As a result, there was not a single war, but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent. &lt;unk&gt; or disorganised however, a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the &lt;unk&gt;th century and continuing into the early &lt;unk&gt;th century. This warfare &lt;unk&gt; the popular and at times academic &lt;unk&gt; myth &lt;unk&gt; of peaceful settlement in Australia. Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence, resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres. Among the most famous is the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; in Western Australia in &lt;unk&gt;. Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however, and after the &lt;unk&gt; Creek massacre in New South Wales in &lt;unk&gt; seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings. However, in Tasmania the so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called Black War was fought between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and aimed at driving most of the island &lt;unk&gt;s native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas. Although it began in failure for the British, it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population. It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly &lt;unk&gt; by Europeans on &lt;unk&gt;. Although many more &lt;unk&gt; died than British, this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans. Aboriginal tactics varied, but were mainly based on pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; existing hunting and fighting practices &lt;unk&gt; using &lt;unk&gt;, clubs and other primitive weapons. &lt;unk&gt;nlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America, on the main &lt;unk&gt; failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans. Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms, this was not widespread. The &lt;unk&gt; were never a serious military threat to European settlers, regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them. On occasions large groups of &lt;unk&gt; attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued, during which the &lt;unk&gt; would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage. This could sometimes be effective, with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents, waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their &lt;unk&gt; while the settlers &lt;unk&gt;. However, such open warfare usually proved more costly for the &lt;unk&gt; than the Europeans. Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms. However, the advantages afforded by firearms have often been &lt;unk&gt;. Prior to the late &lt;unk&gt;th century, firearms were often &lt;unk&gt; muzzle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loading, smooth &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bore, single shot &lt;unk&gt; with flint &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; lock mechanisms. Such weapons produced a low rate of fire, while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt;. These deficiencies may have initially given the &lt;unk&gt; an advantage, allowing them to move in close and engage with &lt;unk&gt; or clubs. Yet by &lt;unk&gt; significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage, with the six &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; shot &lt;unk&gt; revolver, the &lt;unk&gt; single shot breech &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; loading rifle and later the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Henry rifle, as well as rapid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle, becoming available. These weapons, when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of &lt;unk&gt;, often proved successful. The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; moving, often hidden enemies. Tactics employed included night &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time surprise attacks, and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks. The conflict lasted for over &lt;unk&gt; years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia. Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May &lt;unk&gt;, it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the &lt;unk&gt;s. As the frontier moved west so did the conflict, pushing into outback New South Wales in the &lt;unk&gt;s. In Tasmania, fighting can be traced from &lt;unk&gt; to the &lt;unk&gt;s, while in &lt;unk&gt;ictoria and the southern parts of South Australia, the majority of the violence occurred during the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s. The south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; west of Western Australia experienced warfare from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The war in &lt;unk&gt;ueensland began in the area around Brisbane in the &lt;unk&gt;s and continued until &lt;unk&gt;, moving to central &lt;unk&gt;ueensland in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s, and then to northern &lt;unk&gt;ueensland from the &lt;unk&gt;s to &lt;unk&gt;. In Western Australia, the violence moved north with European settlement, reaching the &lt;unk&gt; region by &lt;unk&gt;, with violent clashes continuing until the &lt;unk&gt;s. In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still, especially in central Australia, continuing from the &lt;unk&gt;s to the &lt;unk&gt;s. One estimate of casualties places European deaths at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while at least &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; are believed to have perished. Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the &lt;unk&gt;th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Zealand Wars, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; War &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;ictorian ship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria was dispatched to help the New Zealand colonial government in its war against M&lt;unk&gt;ori in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;ictoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against M&lt;unk&gt;ori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Invasion of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In late &lt;unk&gt;, the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the &lt;unk&gt; province against the M&lt;unk&gt;ori. &lt;unk&gt; settlement on confiscated land, more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians ( over half of whom were from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria &lt;unk&gt; were recruited to form four &lt;unk&gt; Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing &lt;unk&gt; conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; East, &lt;unk&gt; Hill, &lt;unk&gt; and Te &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; than &lt;unk&gt; were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; Regiments disbanded in &lt;unk&gt;. However, many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade, while many others had returned to Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Colonial military forces, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt;, each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence. The colonies had gained responsible government between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for the colonies ended in &lt;unk&gt;, the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units &lt;unk&gt; they remained too small and &lt;unk&gt; to be considered armies in the modern sense. By &lt;unk&gt;, the forces numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with the colonies raising &lt;unk&gt; to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China. Despite a reputation of colonial &lt;unk&gt;, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the &lt;unk&gt;s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General &lt;unk&gt;ames Edwards &lt;unk&gt; who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces &lt;unk&gt; to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid &lt;unk&gt; of brigades of infantry. As a consequence he called for a &lt;unk&gt; of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies. Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be &lt;unk&gt; and for professional units &lt;unk&gt; obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific &lt;unk&gt; to replace the volunteer forces. These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant, Major General Edward Hutton, however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria &lt;unk&gt; the proposal. These reforms remaining unresolved however, and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies. With the exception of Western Australia, the colonies also operated their own navies. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ictoria received its own naval vessel, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, and its deployment to New Zealand in &lt;unk&gt; during the First &lt;unk&gt; War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas. The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats for the defence of harbours and rivers, as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts. &lt;unk&gt;ictoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies, with the ironclad &lt;unk&gt; Cerberus in service from &lt;unk&gt;, as well as the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy, three small gunboats and five torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats. New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in &lt;unk&gt; and by the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century had two small torpedo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; boats and a &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Maritime Defence Force was established in &lt;unk&gt;, while South Australia operated a single ship, HMCS Protector. Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps, while Western Australia &lt;unk&gt;s only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery. Naval personnel from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria took part in the suppression of the &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion in China in &lt;unk&gt;, while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action. The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in &lt;unk&gt;, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sudan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the early years of the &lt;unk&gt;s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed &lt;unk&gt;, known as Mahdi to his followers. In &lt;unk&gt;, as part of the &lt;unk&gt; War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of &lt;unk&gt; their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the evacuation, but he was killed in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February &lt;unk&gt;, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent &lt;unk&gt;s expenses. The New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; consisted of an infantry battalion of &lt;unk&gt; men and &lt;unk&gt; officers, and an artillery battery of &lt;unk&gt; men and sailed from Sydney on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. The contingent arrived in &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Guards. They subsequently marched for &lt;unk&gt; in a large &lt;unk&gt; square &lt;unk&gt; formation made up of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. Reaching the village, they burned &lt;unk&gt; and returned to &lt;unk&gt; : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting. Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards &lt;unk&gt;, on the Nile. The Australians were then assigned to guard duties, but soon a camel corps was raised and &lt;unk&gt; men volunteered. They &lt;unk&gt; on a reconnaissance to &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; May and were heavily involved in a &lt;unk&gt; during which more than &lt;unk&gt; Arabs were killed or captured. On &lt;unk&gt; May, they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March. Meanwhile, the artillery were posted at &lt;unk&gt; and drilled for a month, but they soon rejoined the camp at &lt;unk&gt;. Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in &lt;unk&gt;. The New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; sailed for home on &lt;unk&gt; May, arriving in Sydney on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. Approximately &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second Boer War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result, led to the Second Boer War in &lt;unk&gt;. Pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the deployment of British forces, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Orange Free State and the &lt;unk&gt; Republic under President Paul &lt;unk&gt; declared war on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate &lt;unk&gt; to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of &lt;unk&gt; men from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; who had been training in England before the war, &lt;unk&gt; diverted to South Africa. On &lt;unk&gt; November, the &lt;unk&gt; came under fire for the first time near &lt;unk&gt;, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them. Following a series of minor victories, the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt;, although no Australian units were involved. The first &lt;unk&gt; of infantry from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on &lt;unk&gt; November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel &lt;unk&gt;ohn Charles &lt;unk&gt;. With a need for increased mobility, they were soon converted into mounted infantry. Further units from &lt;unk&gt;ueensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front. The first casualties occurred soon after at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, after &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians, British and artillery attacked a Boer &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; David &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;ictor &lt;unk&gt;ones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward &lt;unk&gt;. Regardless, the &lt;unk&gt; were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting, more than &lt;unk&gt; were killed and another &lt;unk&gt; taken prisoner. Five hundred &lt;unk&gt; and the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt; subsequently took part in the Siege of &lt;unk&gt; in February &lt;unk&gt;. Despite serious set &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; backs at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; and with &lt;unk&gt; still under siege &lt;unk&gt; the British mounted a five division counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt;ohn French with the New South Wales &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, &lt;unk&gt; was relieved following the battles of &lt;unk&gt; River and &lt;unk&gt;, and the retreating &lt;unk&gt; defeated at &lt;unk&gt;, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The British entered &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died. Still the advance continued, with the drive to &lt;unk&gt; in May including more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians. &lt;unk&gt;ohannesburg fell on &lt;unk&gt; May, and the &lt;unk&gt; withdrew from &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une. &lt;unk&gt; was relieved on &lt;unk&gt; May. Following the defeat of the &lt;unk&gt; republics still the &lt;unk&gt; held out, forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply. This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;, with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; riding and shooting skills, but little military experience. After Federation in &lt;unk&gt;, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa, although they saw little fighting before the war ended. Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units, instead of returning home after discharge. These soldiers were part of the British Army, and were subject to British military discipline. Such units included the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Peter &lt;unk&gt; served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes. With the guerrillas requiring supplies, &lt;unk&gt; de la Rey lead a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against &lt;unk&gt;, on the &lt;unk&gt; River in Western &lt;unk&gt;. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by &lt;unk&gt; Australians and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The attack began on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; with heavy shelling causing &lt;unk&gt; casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the &lt;unk&gt;, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted &lt;unk&gt; days, during which more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the &lt;unk&gt; eventually retired. The Siege of &lt;unk&gt; River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on &lt;unk&gt; August. In response the British adopted counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency tactics, including a &lt;unk&gt; earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of &lt;unk&gt; and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results. By mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the bulk of the fighting was over, and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer &lt;unk&gt; or &lt;unk&gt;, overwhelming them with superior numbers. &lt;unk&gt; of warfare in last months of &lt;unk&gt;, the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; and were involved in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, killing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, wounding &lt;unk&gt;, and capturing &lt;unk&gt; for the loss of five dead and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Other notable Australian actions included &lt;unk&gt;, Pink Hill, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Australians were not always successful however, suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;ictorian Mounted Rifles lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded at &lt;unk&gt;, near &lt;unk&gt; after poor security allowed a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to surprise them. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;ueensland Imperial &lt;unk&gt; lost &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt;ltimately the &lt;unk&gt; were defeated, and the war ended on &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt;. In all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in South Africa, and perhaps another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed in action, &lt;unk&gt; died of disease and &lt;unk&gt; missing in action, while a further &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. Six Australians were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Rebellion in China began in &lt;unk&gt;, and a number of western nations &lt;unk&gt; including many European powers, the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, and &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt; soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In &lt;unk&gt;une, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China. The colonies also offered to assist further, but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa, they had to rely on naval forces for manpower. The force dispatched was a modest one, with Britain accepting &lt;unk&gt; men from &lt;unk&gt;ictoria, &lt;unk&gt; from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William &lt;unk&gt;. Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade &lt;unk&gt;, who had been trained in both ship handling and &lt;unk&gt; to fulfil their coastal defence role. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were &lt;unk&gt; naval officers and sailors and &lt;unk&gt; permanent soldiers headquartered at &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors, while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the &lt;unk&gt; Marine Light Infantry. The &lt;unk&gt; from New South Wales and &lt;unk&gt;ictoria sailed for China on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. Arriving in &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians provided &lt;unk&gt; men to an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at &lt;unk&gt; Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived too late to take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; was captured by western forces. The &lt;unk&gt; joined a force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men on a ten &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day march to the fort, once again only to find that it had already surrendered. The &lt;unk&gt; then garrisoned &lt;unk&gt; and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in &lt;unk&gt;. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and &lt;unk&gt; duties in the Gulf of &lt;unk&gt;, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, &lt;unk&gt; performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as &lt;unk&gt; and fire &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fighters. They left China in March &lt;unk&gt;, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order. Six Australians died from sickness and injury, but none were killed as a result of enemy action. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian military forces at Federation, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies. &lt;unk&gt;nder the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ordination of Australia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind &lt;unk&gt;, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army &lt;unk&gt; and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established. The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; and all the colonial forces &lt;unk&gt; including those still in South Africa &lt;unk&gt; became part of the new force. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; colonial soldiers, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; professional soldiers, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; paid militia and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; unpaid volunteers, were subsequently transferred. The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act &lt;unk&gt; brought all the units under one piece of legislation. This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia. However, the majority of soldiers remained in militia units, known as the Citizen Military Forces ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Major General Sir Edward Hutton &lt;unk&gt; a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces &lt;unk&gt; subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on &lt;unk&gt; December and set to work &lt;unk&gt; an integrated structure for the new army. In &lt;unk&gt;, following a report by Lord &lt;unk&gt; the Royal Military College, &lt;unk&gt; was established, as was a system of universal National Service. Prior to federation each self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; governing colony had operated its own naval force. These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities, forcing the separate colonies to &lt;unk&gt; the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades. The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In &lt;unk&gt; Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and &lt;unk&gt;, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government &lt;unk&gt;s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested &lt;unk&gt; that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was unimpressed, and in &lt;unk&gt; invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia. This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ton River &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in &lt;unk&gt;, absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads, consisting of the battlecruiser &lt;unk&gt; Australia, three light cruisers, and three destroyers, while several other ships were still under construction. And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force. The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC &lt;unk&gt; was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in &lt;unk&gt;, prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in &lt;unk&gt; and was later separated in &lt;unk&gt; to form the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the second oldest air force in the world. Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First World War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of hostilities &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War, the Australian government rapidly followed suit, with Prime Minister &lt;unk&gt;oseph Cook declaring on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt;... when the Empire is at war, so also is Australia &lt;unk&gt; and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia. This was itself in part due to the large number of British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born citizens and first generation Anglo &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Australians that made up the Australian population at the time. Indeed, by the end of the war almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain. As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act &lt;unk&gt;, an all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF &lt;unk&gt; was formed and recruitment began on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;. The government pledged &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. &lt;unk&gt; and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under &lt;unk&gt; plans drawn up in &lt;unk&gt;. The first commander was Major General William Bridges, who also assumed command of the &lt;unk&gt;st Division. Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war, although small air and naval forces were also committed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Occupation of German New Guinea &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany &lt;unk&gt;s Pacific colonies. The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man volunteer force &lt;unk&gt; separate from the AIF &lt;unk&gt; and consisting of an infantry battalion plus &lt;unk&gt; naval &lt;unk&gt; and ex &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sailors, was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes. The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on &lt;unk&gt;, and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands, and at Rabaul in German New Guinea. The force reached Rabaul on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and occupied it the next day, encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. German New Guinea surrendered on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. Australian losses were light, including six killed during the fighting, but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine &lt;unk&gt; with all &lt;unk&gt; men aboard. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gallipoli &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. During the journey one of the convoy &lt;unk&gt;s naval escorts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Sydney &lt;unk&gt; engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS &lt;unk&gt; at the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; November, in the first ship &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy. Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front, the Australians were instead sent to British &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controlled Egypt to pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal, and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers. &lt;unk&gt; to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious &lt;unk&gt; at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; commanded by British general William Birdwood &lt;unk&gt; subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt;. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving its objectives. Australian casualties totalled &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; killed. For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, &lt;unk&gt; April, is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, as well as Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original &lt;unk&gt;, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Egypt and Palestine &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In &lt;unk&gt; the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australian &lt;unk&gt;s first saw combat during the &lt;unk&gt; uprising in the &lt;unk&gt; Desert and the Nile &lt;unk&gt;alley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai, although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February. The advance entered Palestine and an initial, unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;, while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on &lt;unk&gt; April. A third assault occurred between &lt;unk&gt; October and &lt;unk&gt; November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part. The battle was a complete success for the British, over &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; running the Gaza &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Beersheba line and capturing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Turkish soldiers. The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day, after the Australian &lt;unk&gt;th Light Horse Brigade charged more than &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt;. The Turkish trenches were overrun, with the Australians capturing the wells at &lt;unk&gt; and securing the valuable water they contained along with over &lt;unk&gt; prisoners for the loss of &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. Later, Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at &lt;unk&gt; Ridge, &lt;unk&gt;erusalem and the &lt;unk&gt;. The Turkish government surrendered on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nits of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in &lt;unk&gt; and did so with efficiency and brutality, although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process. Meanwhile, the AFC had undergone remarkable development, and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in &lt;unk&gt;, the first operational flight did not occur until &lt;unk&gt; May &lt;unk&gt; however, when the &lt;unk&gt; Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq. The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Western Front &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March &lt;unk&gt;. I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; April &lt;unk&gt; and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front, earning a formidable reputation. Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme, within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division, positioned on the left flank, was the first in action during the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, suffering &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties in a single day. The &lt;unk&gt;st Division entered the line on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, assaulting &lt;unk&gt;, and by the time that they were relieved by the &lt;unk&gt;nd Division on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly, they had suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties. Mouquet Farm was attacked in August, with casualties totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; organise, they had suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties in just &lt;unk&gt; days. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;nd and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line, capturing the town of &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; April, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of &lt;unk&gt;, losing over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; captured. On &lt;unk&gt; April, the &lt;unk&gt;st and &lt;unk&gt;nd Divisions were counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacked near &lt;unk&gt; and were forced to abandon the town, before &lt;unk&gt; it again. The &lt;unk&gt;nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of &lt;unk&gt;, beginning on &lt;unk&gt; May, and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the &lt;unk&gt;st Division. Finally, on &lt;unk&gt; May the &lt;unk&gt;th Division relieved the &lt;unk&gt;st, remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; May. Combined these efforts cost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian casualties. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the II Anzac Corps &lt;unk&gt; along with two British corps &lt;unk&gt; launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres. The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; kg &lt;unk&gt; of explosives that had been placed underneath the &lt;unk&gt; ridge, destroying the German trenches. The advance was virtually unopposed, and despite strong German counterattacks the next day, it succeeded. Australian casualties during the Battle of &lt;unk&gt; included nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the &lt;unk&gt; Plateau, between September and November &lt;unk&gt;. Individual actions took place at &lt;unk&gt; Road, &lt;unk&gt; Wood, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; casualties. On &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; effort to win the war, &lt;unk&gt; sixty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; three divisions over a &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; front. As the Allies fell back the &lt;unk&gt;rd and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme. The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide. By late May the Germans had pushed to within &lt;unk&gt; miles ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of Paris. During this time the Australians fought at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Wood, &lt;unk&gt;, and Hamel. At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps, Lieutenant General &lt;unk&gt;ohn Monash, successfully used combined arms &lt;unk&gt; including aircraft, artillery and armour &lt;unk&gt; in an attack for the first time. The German offensive ground to a halt in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly and a brief lull followed, during which the Australians undertook a series of raids, known as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Allies soon launched their own offensive &lt;unk&gt; the Hundred Days Offensive &lt;unk&gt; ultimately ending the war. Beginning on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens. &lt;unk&gt;sing the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel, significant gains were made on what became known as the &lt;unk&gt; Black Day &lt;unk&gt; of the German Army. The offensive continued for four months, and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Mont St &lt;unk&gt;uentin, before their final engagement of the war on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt;. The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on &lt;unk&gt; November &lt;unk&gt;. In all &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; served overseas. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded ( a total casualty rate of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Two &lt;unk&gt; on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly towards the end of the fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war. The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also. Indeed, for many Australians the nation &lt;unk&gt;s involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor, while many of the notions of Australian character and &lt;unk&gt; that exist today have their origins in the war. &lt;unk&gt; Australians were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross during the First World War. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Inter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war years &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Russian Civil War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the &lt;unk&gt; party assumed power in October &lt;unk&gt;. Following the end of the First World War, the western powers &lt;unk&gt; including Britain &lt;unk&gt; intervened, giving half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hearted support to the pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; White Russian forces. Although the Australian government refused to commit forces, many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting. A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; repatriation in England, about &lt;unk&gt; Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed. The Royal Australian Navy destroyer &lt;unk&gt; Swan was also briefly engaged, carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late &lt;unk&gt;. Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General, Anton &lt;unk&gt; in South Russia, while several more advised Admiral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Siberia. Later, they also served in Mesopotamia as part of &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt; Mission, although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India, and did little fighting. Although the motivations of those Australian &lt;unk&gt;s that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at, it seems unlikely to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for &lt;unk&gt; and courage, winning the only two &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In October &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; Adelaide was called to the British Solomon Islands &lt;unk&gt; as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by &lt;unk&gt; natives at &lt;unk&gt; on the island of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, known as the &lt;unk&gt; massacre. Arriving at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, the ship proceeded to &lt;unk&gt; to protect the landing of three platoons of troops, then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the &lt;unk&gt;. The ship &lt;unk&gt;s personnel took no part in operations ashore, providing only logistic and communications support. Adelaide returned to Australia on &lt;unk&gt; November. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Spanish Civil War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War, although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades. The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other &lt;unk&gt;, such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion, rather than forming their own units. Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons, while a number were Spanish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin. At least &lt;unk&gt; Australians volunteered, with only one &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Bull, a conservative &lt;unk&gt; who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War &lt;unk&gt; known to have fought for General Francisco Franco &lt;unk&gt;s Nationalist forces. While a celebrated cause for the Australian left &lt;unk&gt; particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement &lt;unk&gt; the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality. Australian opposition to the Republican cause was &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on an anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; communist basis, rather than a pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Nationalist basis. &lt;unk&gt;, although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels, they received no public support. Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time, however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist, no action was taken. Consequently, returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the &lt;unk&gt; and Services League of Australia ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries, at least &lt;unk&gt; were killed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Second World War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Europe and the Middle East &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia entered the Second World War on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;. At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and &lt;unk&gt; for war. &lt;unk&gt; for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( &lt;unk&gt;nd AIF &lt;unk&gt; began in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Four infantry divisions were formed during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, through which almost &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were trained during the war. The Australian military &lt;unk&gt;s first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa. During &lt;unk&gt; the light cruiser &lt;unk&gt; Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Iron Flotilla &lt;unk&gt; by Nazi Propaganda Minister &lt;unk&gt;oseph Goebbels &lt;unk&gt; a title proudly accepted by the ships &lt;unk&gt; took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and sank several Italian warships. The Army first saw action in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, when the &lt;unk&gt;th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The division assaulted and captured &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary and &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary, with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; February. In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece, and was replaced by the &lt;unk&gt;th Division. The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during &lt;unk&gt;. During April, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece. At the end of this campaign, the &lt;unk&gt;th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete. The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May, which also ended in defeat for the Allies. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were captured in these campaigns, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat. The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division and a brigade of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division were besieged at &lt;unk&gt; ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October. During &lt;unk&gt;une, the main body of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, a brigade of the &lt;unk&gt;th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Lebanon Campaign against the &lt;unk&gt; French. Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;uly. The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, after the outbreak of the Pacific War. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East, and played a key role in the First Battle of El &lt;unk&gt; during &lt;unk&gt;une and the Second Battle of El &lt;unk&gt; in October. The division returned to Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, but several RAAF squadrons and &lt;unk&gt; warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from &lt;unk&gt; until the end of the war. The RAAF &lt;unk&gt;s role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia &lt;unk&gt;s main contribution to the defeat of Germany. Approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF &lt;unk&gt; Command between &lt;unk&gt; and the end of the war. Australians took part in all of &lt;unk&gt; Command &lt;unk&gt;s major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. Australian aircrew in &lt;unk&gt; Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost &lt;unk&gt; percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner. Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Asia and the Pacific &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; From the &lt;unk&gt;s Australia &lt;unk&gt;s defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy, which was embodied by the &lt;unk&gt; Singapore strategy &lt;unk&gt;. This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to &lt;unk&gt;apanese aggression in the region. To this end, a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; as the threat from &lt;unk&gt;apan increased. However, as a result of the emphasis on co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operation with Britain, relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Pacific region. Measures were taken to improve Australia &lt;unk&gt;s defences as war with &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, but these proved inadequate. In December &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the &lt;unk&gt;th Division, most of which was stationed in Malaya, and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia. The RAAF was equipped with &lt;unk&gt; aircraft, most of which were obsolete trainers, and the &lt;unk&gt; had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters. The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War. The &lt;unk&gt;th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller &lt;unk&gt;apanese invasion force which landed on &lt;unk&gt; December. The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of &lt;unk&gt;anuary, but was forced to surrender on &lt;unk&gt; February after the &lt;unk&gt;apanese captured much of the island. Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early &lt;unk&gt; at Rabaul, and in Ambon, Timor, and &lt;unk&gt;ava. The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese on &lt;unk&gt; February, to prevent it from being used as an Allied base. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians were taken prisoner in early &lt;unk&gt; and endured harsh conditions in &lt;unk&gt;apanese captivity. The prisoners were subjected to &lt;unk&gt;, denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards. As a result, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian prisoners died in captivity. The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the &lt;unk&gt;apanese would invade the Australian mainland. While elements of the Imperial &lt;unk&gt;apanese Navy proposed this in early &lt;unk&gt;, it was judged to be impossible by the &lt;unk&gt;apanese Imperial General Headquarters, which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by capturing New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. This fact was not known by the Allies at the time, and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion. Large numbers of &lt;unk&gt;nited States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early &lt;unk&gt;, and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March. Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the &lt;unk&gt;apanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the &lt;unk&gt; Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and &lt;unk&gt;SAAF. Australian and &lt;unk&gt;S Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the &lt;unk&gt;apanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fought Battle of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Australian Army also defeated a &lt;unk&gt;apanese attempt to capture the town of &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; and went onto the offensive in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Lae campaign in April. In late &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th Divisions played an important role in Operation &lt;unk&gt;, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula during the &lt;unk&gt; Peninsula campaign and &lt;unk&gt; Range campaign. The Australian mainland came under attack during &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;apanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;anuary to &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the &lt;unk&gt;S and Australia and New Guinea, but were unsuccessful. &lt;unk&gt;apanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against &lt;unk&gt;apanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Australia &lt;unk&gt;s role in the Pacific War declined from &lt;unk&gt;. The increasing size of the &lt;unk&gt;S forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production. Nevertheless, the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active, and agreed to MacArthur &lt;unk&gt;s proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns. In late &lt;unk&gt;, Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced &lt;unk&gt;S garrisons in eastern New Guinea, New Britain, and &lt;unk&gt;, and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining &lt;unk&gt;apanese forces there. In May &lt;unk&gt;, I Corps, the Australian First Tactical Air Force and &lt;unk&gt;SAAF and &lt;unk&gt;SN units began the Borneo Campaign, which continued until the end of the war. These campaigns contributed little to &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s defeat and remain controversial. Following &lt;unk&gt;apan &lt;unk&gt;s surrender on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt; Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored. Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of &lt;unk&gt;apanese personnel. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians enlisted during the war, while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; served overseas. Casualties included &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; killed and another &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Crosses were awarded to Australians. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war period &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and peace &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time defence arrangements &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in &lt;unk&gt;. Plans for post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war defence arrangements were &lt;unk&gt; on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, &lt;unk&gt; others ships in commission and another &lt;unk&gt; in reserved. The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of &lt;unk&gt; squadrons, including four manned by the Citizen Air Force. Meanwhile, in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time force of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men in the Citizen Military Forces. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, while the &lt;unk&gt; was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; raised on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In the immediate post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which included forces from Australia, Britain, India and New Zealand. At its height in &lt;unk&gt; the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade, four warships and three fighter squadrons, totalling &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel. The Australian Army component initially consisted of the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade which arrived in &lt;unk&gt;apan in February &lt;unk&gt; and was based in &lt;unk&gt; Prefecture. The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the &lt;unk&gt;st, &lt;unk&gt;nd and &lt;unk&gt;rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt;th Brigade became the &lt;unk&gt;st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December &lt;unk&gt;, forming the basis of the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war Regular Army. From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of &lt;unk&gt;apan was reduced to a single under &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strength battalion. Australian forces remained until September &lt;unk&gt; when the &lt;unk&gt; ceased operations, although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean &lt;unk&gt; following the outbreak of the Korean War in &lt;unk&gt;. The RAAF component consisted of Nos. &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons as part of No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing RAAF flying P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mustangs, initially based at &lt;unk&gt; from March &lt;unk&gt;, before transferring to &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;. However, by &lt;unk&gt; only No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron remained in &lt;unk&gt;apan. A total of ten &lt;unk&gt; warships served in &lt;unk&gt;apan during this period, including &lt;unk&gt; Ships Australia, Hobart, Shropshire, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Murchison, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; Ships &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; also provided support. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Cold War &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early planning and commitments &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During the early years of the Cold War, Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations, or a coalition led by either the &lt;unk&gt;nited States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they would most likely operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the deployment of No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in &lt;unk&gt; to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Korean War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the North Korean Army ( KPA &lt;unk&gt; crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul, which fell in less than a week. North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the &lt;unk&gt;nited States offered its assistance to South Korea. In response the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Security Council requested members to assist in &lt;unk&gt; the North Korean attack. Australia initially contributed P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Mustang fighter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bomber aircraft from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF and infantry from the &lt;unk&gt;rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; RAR &lt;unk&gt;, both of which were stationed in &lt;unk&gt;apan as part of the &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The &lt;unk&gt; frigate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and the destroyer &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, were also committed. Later, an aircraft carrier strike group aboard &lt;unk&gt; Sydney was added to the force. By the time &lt;unk&gt; RAR arrived in Pusan on &lt;unk&gt; September, the North Koreans were in retreat following the &lt;unk&gt; landings. As a part of the invasion force under the &lt;unk&gt;N Supreme Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of &lt;unk&gt; near &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October, before advancing towards the &lt;unk&gt; River. Further successful actions followed at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt; and at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;. North Korean casualties were heavy, while Australian losses included their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green, who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on &lt;unk&gt; November. Meanwhile, during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved &lt;unk&gt; divisions of the People &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;olunteer Army across the &lt;unk&gt; River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA. &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt;S and South Korean intelligence, the &lt;unk&gt;th Army Group crossed the border on &lt;unk&gt; October and penetrated up to &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; into North Korea, and were reinforced in early November by &lt;unk&gt; divisions from the &lt;unk&gt;th Army Group ; in total &lt;unk&gt; divisions composed of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; men. &lt;unk&gt; RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; November. The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake. Following the Chinese intervention, the &lt;unk&gt;N forces were defeated in successive battles and &lt;unk&gt; RAR was forced to withdraw to the &lt;unk&gt;th parallel. A series of battles followed at &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital. Further fighting occurred at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt; following another Chinese advance, and later at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; San between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt; as the &lt;unk&gt;N resumed the offensive. Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in &lt;unk&gt;, with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of &lt;unk&gt;. On &lt;unk&gt; April, Chinese forces attacked the &lt;unk&gt; valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw. Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance. After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions, at the cost of &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. In &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian, British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian &lt;unk&gt;st Commonwealth Division. The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River. The &lt;unk&gt;st Commonwealth Division counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attacked on &lt;unk&gt; October, capturing a number of objectives including Hill &lt;unk&gt; and Hill &lt;unk&gt; during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated. Australian casualties included &lt;unk&gt; dead and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. The &lt;unk&gt; then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War, in which men lived in tunnels, redoubts, and &lt;unk&gt; forts behind barbed wire defences. From &lt;unk&gt; until the end of the war, &lt;unk&gt; RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division &lt;unk&gt;s positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River. Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions. In March &lt;unk&gt;, Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions, sending &lt;unk&gt; RAR. This battalion remained in Korea for &lt;unk&gt; months, before being replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR in April &lt;unk&gt;. The Australians fought their last battle during &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, with &lt;unk&gt; RAR holding off a &lt;unk&gt; Chinese attack along the &lt;unk&gt; River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded. &lt;unk&gt; were suspended on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served during the war, with &lt;unk&gt; killed, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; wounded and &lt;unk&gt; captured. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Malayan Emergency, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Malayan Emergency was declared on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Australian involvement began in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, when in response to a British request, six &lt;unk&gt; from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs, troop movement, as well as &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; drops, while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT &lt;unk&gt; jungle bases. The RAAF were particularly successful, and in one such mission known as Operation &lt;unk&gt;, five Lincoln bombers destroyed &lt;unk&gt; communist camps, killed &lt;unk&gt; communists and forced one into surrender, in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops. The &lt;unk&gt; were withdrawn in &lt;unk&gt;, and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. &lt;unk&gt; Wing. Based at RAAF Base &lt;unk&gt; they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas. Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October &lt;unk&gt; as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. In &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula, consisting of the &lt;unk&gt;nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; RAR &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; RAR mainly participated in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; operations over the next &lt;unk&gt; months, conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases, as part of &lt;unk&gt;th British Commonwealth Brigade. Contact with the enemy was &lt;unk&gt; and results small, achieving relatively few kills. &lt;unk&gt; RAR left Malaysia October &lt;unk&gt; to be replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR. &lt;unk&gt; RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving &lt;unk&gt; insurgents back into the jungle of &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes. Again contact was limited, although &lt;unk&gt; RAR had more success than its predecessor. By late &lt;unk&gt;, operations against the &lt;unk&gt; were in their final phase, and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border. &lt;unk&gt; RAR left Malaysia October &lt;unk&gt; and was replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR. Though patrolling the border &lt;unk&gt; RAR did not make contact with the insurgents, and in October &lt;unk&gt; it was replaced by &lt;unk&gt; RAR, which stayed in Malaysia until August &lt;unk&gt;. The Malayan Emergency officially ended on &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;. Australia also provided artillery and engineer support, along with an air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; field construction squadron. The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters, firing on suspected communist positions between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served and &lt;unk&gt; died in Malaya &lt;unk&gt; although only &lt;unk&gt; were on operations &lt;unk&gt; and another &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military and Naval growth during the &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; At the start of the &lt;unk&gt;s, Prime Minister Robert &lt;unk&gt; greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government &lt;unk&gt;s policy of &lt;unk&gt; Forward Defence &lt;unk&gt; in South East Asia. In &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; announced a large increase in defence spending. The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; over three years from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ; providing a full three &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; brigade division with nine battalions. The RAAF and &lt;unk&gt; would also both be increased by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, conscription or National Service was re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; introduced under the National Service Act, for selected &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; olds based on date of birth, for a period of two years &lt;unk&gt; continuous full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In &lt;unk&gt;, three Charles F. Adams &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers were purchased from the &lt;unk&gt;nited States to replace the ageing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class destroyers. Traditionally, the &lt;unk&gt; had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant. &lt;unk&gt; Perth and &lt;unk&gt; Hobart joined the fleet in &lt;unk&gt;, followed by &lt;unk&gt; Brisbane in &lt;unk&gt;. Other projects included the construction of six River &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class frigates, the conversion of the aircraft carrier &lt;unk&gt; Melbourne to an anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; submarine role, the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters, and the purchase of six Oberon &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; class submarines. The RAAF took delivery of their first &lt;unk&gt; fighters in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; No. &lt;unk&gt;, No. &lt;unk&gt; and No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadrons with them. The service also received American F &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; strike aircraft, C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transports, P &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian &lt;unk&gt; trainers. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Indonesia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Malaysia &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The Indonesia &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Malaysia confrontation was fought from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia, with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state. The war remained limited, and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo, although a number of Indonesian &lt;unk&gt; and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur. As part of Australia &lt;unk&gt;s continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia, army, naval and &lt;unk&gt; units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve. Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only. On two occasions Australian troops from &lt;unk&gt; RAR were used to help &lt;unk&gt; up &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; and airborne incursions at &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, in September and October &lt;unk&gt;. Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo. During the early phases, British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian &lt;unk&gt; Indonesian border, and to protect population centres. However, by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing the border into &lt;unk&gt; to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the &lt;unk&gt; to remain on the defensive, under the &lt;unk&gt; Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions. &lt;unk&gt; RAR deployed to Borneo in March &lt;unk&gt;, and served in &lt;unk&gt; until the end of &lt;unk&gt;uly, operating on both sides of the border. The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones &lt;unk&gt; including at Sungei &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents. &lt;unk&gt; RAR served a less &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; eventful tour between April and August &lt;unk&gt;, and also operated over the border, successfully &lt;unk&gt; with the &lt;unk&gt; on a number of occasions. A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was also deployed in &lt;unk&gt; and again in &lt;unk&gt;, taking part in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the &lt;unk&gt;, even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance. Other units included artillery and engineers, while a number of &lt;unk&gt; ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in the Singapore Strait. The RAAF played a relatively minor role, although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated. Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia, while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; border missions only occurred in &lt;unk&gt;. Following a military coup in Indonesia in early &lt;unk&gt; which brought General &lt;unk&gt; to power, a peace treaty was signed in August &lt;unk&gt; which ended the conflict. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served during &lt;unk&gt; ; casualties included &lt;unk&gt; dead, with seven killed in action and eight wounded. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War, and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the &lt;unk&gt;s and early &lt;unk&gt;s. As a consequence, Australia supported South &lt;unk&gt;ietnam throughout the early &lt;unk&gt;s. In &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, the leader of the South &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese government, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, asked for assistance from the &lt;unk&gt;S and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North &lt;unk&gt;ietnam. Australia offered &lt;unk&gt; military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team &lt;unk&gt;ietnam, which became known simply as &lt;unk&gt; The Team &lt;unk&gt;. They arrived in &lt;unk&gt;uly and August &lt;unk&gt;, beginning Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in the war. Later in August &lt;unk&gt;, the RAAF sent a flight of &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft to the port city of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. However, with the security situation in South &lt;unk&gt;ietnam continuing to deteriorate, the &lt;unk&gt;S increased its involvement to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; combat troops by early &lt;unk&gt;. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the &lt;unk&gt; RAR to serve with the &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; Airborne Brigade in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; province in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions, including Gang &lt;unk&gt;, Operation &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In March &lt;unk&gt;, the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized unit &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt;st Australian Task Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to replace &lt;unk&gt; RAR. Included were a large number of conscripts, under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme. &lt;unk&gt; of two infantry battalions as well as armour, aviation, artillery and other support arms, the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, in &lt;unk&gt; Tuy Province. Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF. At the Battle of Long Tan on &lt;unk&gt; August &lt;unk&gt;, D Company, &lt;unk&gt; RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a &lt;unk&gt;iet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself. &lt;unk&gt; Australians were killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while &lt;unk&gt; communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield. The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over &lt;unk&gt; Tuy Province and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February &lt;unk&gt; the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing &lt;unk&gt; men killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded in a single week, the bulk during Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Yet with the &lt;unk&gt; Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout &lt;unk&gt;, the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was subsequently deployed &lt;unk&gt; infiltration routes leading to Saigon to &lt;unk&gt; communist movement against the capital as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt; during the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in May and &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. At Fire Support &lt;unk&gt; Coral and &lt;unk&gt; the Australians had clashed with regular North &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese Army and &lt;unk&gt;iet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During &lt;unk&gt; days of fighting Australian casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while communist casualties included &lt;unk&gt; killed confirmed by body count, &lt;unk&gt; possibly killed, &lt;unk&gt; wounded and &lt;unk&gt; captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; and early &lt;unk&gt; and Long &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. At the height of the Australian commitment, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in &lt;unk&gt;, and four &lt;unk&gt; destroyers joined &lt;unk&gt;S patrols in the waters off North &lt;unk&gt;ietnam. The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November &lt;unk&gt;. As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of &lt;unk&gt;ietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, &lt;unk&gt; RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. Australian combat forces were further reduced during &lt;unk&gt; as part of a phased withdrawal, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ceased operations in October. Meanwhile, the advisors remained to train South &lt;unk&gt;ietnamese troops until withdrawn on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; by the newly elected Labor government of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War was Australia &lt;unk&gt;s longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support, as the nation &lt;unk&gt;s military involvement increased a vocal anti &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war movement developed. More than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australians served in &lt;unk&gt;ietnam ; &lt;unk&gt; were killed and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were wounded. Four were awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ietnam era &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Creation of the Australian Defence Force, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Although the importance of &lt;unk&gt; joint &lt;unk&gt; warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; ordination between the services in the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war era, with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military &lt;unk&gt;s experiences in the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War. In &lt;unk&gt;, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur &lt;unk&gt;, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff. The &lt;unk&gt; Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence &lt;unk&gt; ( Defence, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Supply &lt;unk&gt; into a single Department of Defence in &lt;unk&gt;, while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished. On &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt;, the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified, all &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; volunteer, professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Today, the &lt;unk&gt; is headquartered at Russell &lt;unk&gt; in Canberra and is divided into Air, Land, Maritime and Special Operations &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, Northern Command is based in Darwin, and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Defence of Australia, &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ntil the &lt;unk&gt;s, Australia &lt;unk&gt;s military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia &lt;unk&gt;s region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in &lt;unk&gt;, and the British withdrawal &lt;unk&gt; east of Suez &lt;unk&gt; in the early &lt;unk&gt;s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation &lt;unk&gt;s northern maritime approaches ( the &lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sea gap &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against possible attack. In line with this goal, the &lt;unk&gt; was &lt;unk&gt; to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the &lt;unk&gt; and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the &lt;unk&gt; had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; coups d &lt;unk&gt;tat. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the &lt;unk&gt; to improve its capability to rapidly respond to &lt;unk&gt; events. During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; agreed in &lt;unk&gt; to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in &lt;unk&gt;, and the two &lt;unk&gt; fighter squadrons in &lt;unk&gt;. Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft, support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company &lt;unk&gt; have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighter aircraft. Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. &lt;unk&gt; and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the &lt;unk&gt; have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of &lt;unk&gt; and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Gulf War, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the &lt;unk&gt; Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about &lt;unk&gt; personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the &lt;unk&gt; and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some &lt;unk&gt; personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with &lt;unk&gt;S and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; fly zones imposed over Iraq between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Global security, late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Since the late &lt;unk&gt;s, the Australian government had increasingly called upon the &lt;unk&gt; to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world. While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists, several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel. Large peacekeeping deployments were made to &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt;, Cambodia between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and from &lt;unk&gt; onwards. The &lt;unk&gt; election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force structure and role, with the new government &lt;unk&gt;s defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; operation with regional states and Australia &lt;unk&gt;s allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia &lt;unk&gt;s global security interests. In line with this new focus, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s combat effectiveness. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; New Millennium &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; East Timor, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The former &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in &lt;unk&gt;, however, following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; subsequently agreed to allow the East &lt;unk&gt; to vote on autonomy in &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Mission in East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was established to organise and conduct the vote, which was held at the end of August &lt;unk&gt; and resulted with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of voters deciding in favour of independence. However, following the announcement of the results pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military, launched a campaign of violence, looting and &lt;unk&gt; and many East &lt;unk&gt; were killed, while perhaps more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were displaced. &lt;unk&gt;nable to control the violence, Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. Australia, which had contributed police to &lt;unk&gt;, organised and led an international military coalition, known as the International Force for East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;N force operating in accordance with &lt;unk&gt;N resolutions. The total size of the Australian force committed numbered &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, and included a significant ground force, supported by air and naval forces, in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nder the overall command of Australian Major General Peter &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; began arriving on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt; and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting &lt;unk&gt;, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, &lt;unk&gt; re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; established its headquarters in Dili on &lt;unk&gt; September. On &lt;unk&gt; October &lt;unk&gt;, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a &lt;unk&gt;N peacekeeping force, the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; over of command of military operations from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; was completed on &lt;unk&gt; February &lt;unk&gt;. Australia continued to support the &lt;unk&gt;N peacekeeping operation with between &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel, as well as landing craft and &lt;unk&gt; helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and at &lt;unk&gt; in October &lt;unk&gt;. However, with the security situation &lt;unk&gt; the bulk of the Australian and &lt;unk&gt;N forces were withdrawn by &lt;unk&gt;. Two Australians died from non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action. The unexpected deployment to East Timor in &lt;unk&gt; led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to conduct operations outside Australia. This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s ability to mount and sustain such operations. In response, the &lt;unk&gt; Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the &lt;unk&gt; for overseas deployments. The Australian government committed to improve the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of &lt;unk&gt; units, expanding the &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; full &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; per year. In May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;, following unrest between elements of the Timor &lt;unk&gt; Defence Force. Australian forces were involved in a number &lt;unk&gt; during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; at Same on &lt;unk&gt; March &lt;unk&gt;. However, by early &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the security situation had been &lt;unk&gt; and just &lt;unk&gt; Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a &lt;unk&gt;, the International &lt;unk&gt; Force commenced withdrawing from Timor &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in November &lt;unk&gt;, a process which was completed in April &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Afghanistan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on &lt;unk&gt; September &lt;unk&gt;, Australian forces were committed to the American &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; led international coalition against terrorism. The &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s most visible contribution &lt;unk&gt; codenamed Operation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; and again from mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to fight against the &lt;unk&gt;. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from &lt;unk&gt; to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the &lt;unk&gt; National Army. Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Orion surveillance aircraft and three C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since &lt;unk&gt;, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation &lt;unk&gt;. A detachment of four F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; fighter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while two Boeing &lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; air &lt;unk&gt; aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in &lt;unk&gt; to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in &lt;unk&gt; airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction &lt;unk&gt; in April &lt;unk&gt;. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to &lt;unk&gt; by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, with further small increases to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in early &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; insurgency operations in &lt;unk&gt; Province in conjunction &lt;unk&gt;nited States and other coalition forces, including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal. The force consisted of motorised infantry, special forces, engineers, cavalry, artillery and aviation elements. By &lt;unk&gt; it included a combined arms battalion &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; sized battle group known as the &lt;unk&gt; Task Force, and the Special Operations Task Group, both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as well as the &lt;unk&gt; Wing Group flying CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the Force &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in &lt;unk&gt;. In addition, a further &lt;unk&gt; Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support, but are located outside of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, &lt;unk&gt; of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, based out of Al &lt;unk&gt; Air Base in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Arab Emirates. Also included is the deployment of one of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties. Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting, and significant actions included Operation &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; and Operation Perth in &lt;unk&gt;, as well as actions in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, the Shah &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements. Casualties include &lt;unk&gt; killed and &lt;unk&gt; wounded, while another Australian also died serving with the British Army. Four Australians have been awarded the &lt;unk&gt;ictoria Cross for Australia, the first such decorations in forty years. Following a &lt;unk&gt; in forces, the last combat troops were withdrawn on &lt;unk&gt; December &lt;unk&gt; ; however, approximately &lt;unk&gt; personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers, and are stationed in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;. Over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Iraq, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the &lt;unk&gt; invasion of Iraq. The initial contribution was also a modest one, consisting of just &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel &lt;unk&gt; codenamed Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Major force elements included special forces, &lt;unk&gt; and fixed wing aviation and naval units. Army units included elements from the &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando &lt;unk&gt;, a CH &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; detachment and a number of other specialist units. &lt;unk&gt; units included the amphibious ship &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the frigates &lt;unk&gt; Darwin and &lt;unk&gt; Anzac, while the RAAF deployed &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hornets from No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron, a number of AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq, while for a few days, the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the &lt;unk&gt;. During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the &lt;unk&gt;ietnam War, with No. &lt;unk&gt; Squadron flying a total of &lt;unk&gt; sorties and dropping &lt;unk&gt; laser &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; guided bombs. The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially take part in the post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; designated the Al &lt;unk&gt; Task Group and including &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; light armoured vehicles and infantry &lt;unk&gt; was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April &lt;unk&gt; as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. The role of this force was to protect the &lt;unk&gt;apanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The &lt;unk&gt; later became the &lt;unk&gt; Battle Group ( West &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ( W &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, following the hand back of Al &lt;unk&gt; province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel in May &lt;unk&gt; including the &lt;unk&gt; ( W &lt;unk&gt; in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team &lt;unk&gt; Iraq. A &lt;unk&gt; frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and AP &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin &lt;unk&gt; the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, while RAAF and &lt;unk&gt; operations were &lt;unk&gt; to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. Low &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level operations continued, however, with a small Australian force of &lt;unk&gt; soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of &lt;unk&gt; under Operation &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; was finally withdrawn in August &lt;unk&gt;, and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia &lt;unk&gt;s diplomatic presence in Iraq. Although more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel served during operations in Iraq, Australian casualties were relatively light, with two soldiers accidentally killed, while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force. A further &lt;unk&gt; personnel were wounded. Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation &lt;unk&gt;. This operation concluded in November &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military intervention against &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; present &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; a small number of &lt;unk&gt; personnel were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the &lt;unk&gt; Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and C &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct &lt;unk&gt; of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to &lt;unk&gt; arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; controlled northern Iraq. In late September &lt;unk&gt; an Air Task Group ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Special Operations Task Group ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; were deployed to Al &lt;unk&gt; Air Base in the &lt;unk&gt;nited Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. &lt;unk&gt; with F &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Super &lt;unk&gt; strike aircraft, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Multi Role &lt;unk&gt; Transport, and an E &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Airborne Early Warning &lt;unk&gt; Control aircraft, the &lt;unk&gt; began operations on &lt;unk&gt; October. The &lt;unk&gt; is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April &lt;unk&gt; a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; strong unit known as Task Group &lt;unk&gt; was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. &lt;unk&gt; were extended to Syria in September &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Australia &lt;unk&gt;s involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse, and included participation in both &lt;unk&gt;nited Nations sponsored missions, as well as those as part of ad &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; hoc coalitions. Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as &lt;unk&gt; ; however &lt;unk&gt; in comparative international terms, Australia has only been a moderately energetic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for &lt;unk&gt; years &lt;unk&gt; being among the first group of &lt;unk&gt;N military observers in Indonesia in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; its commitments have generally been limited, consisting mostly of small numbers of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level and technical support troops such as &lt;unk&gt;, engineers, &lt;unk&gt;, observers, and police. One significant commitment has been Australia &lt;unk&gt;s ongoing involvement with the long running &lt;unk&gt; Force and Observers in the Sinai. The operational tempo started increasing in the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, when Australia became involved in a series of high &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; profile operations, deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia, &lt;unk&gt;, Somalia, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands. Australia has been involved in close to &lt;unk&gt; separate missions, involving more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; personnel ; &lt;unk&gt; Australians have died during these operations. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Military statistics &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;  &lt;unk&gt; Randy Blythe &lt;unk&gt; case &lt;unk&gt; The Randy Blythe &lt;unk&gt; case was a court case in the Czech Republic, stemming from a &lt;unk&gt; Lamb of God concert in Prague, wherein &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old fan Daniel &lt;unk&gt; sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death. During the investigation, Czech police unsuccessfully asked &lt;unk&gt;nited States authorities for cooperation. When the band returned to the Czech Republic for another concert two years later, its vocalist Randy Blythe was arrested, charged with causing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, and &lt;unk&gt; in custody for five weeks. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, it was proven that Blythe had thrown &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held &lt;unk&gt; liable, and most of the blame lay with &lt;unk&gt; and security members. The &lt;unk&gt; was upheld by the Prague High Court on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; concert incident &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; During a concert on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, in the Prague club, &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; old attending fan. According to &lt;unk&gt; statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper &lt;unk&gt; following Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest, Blythe was chanting &lt;unk&gt; Come on up &lt;unk&gt; between songs, which, the newspaper stated, may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans. The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage, falling backwards directly on his head. According to the same paper, &lt;unk&gt; was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, suffered serious brain trauma, fell into a coma, and died weeks later from his injuries. A report about the concert at issue released on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; by &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage. &lt;unk&gt; The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by &lt;unk&gt; alleged that &lt;unk&gt; Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an &lt;unk&gt; fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (! &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the report by &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage &lt;unk&gt;, while &lt;unk&gt; stated that &lt;unk&gt; the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; approach of the band towards the stage &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; divers... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down. &lt;unk&gt; Following Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest, Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a promoter of the concert, said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe, and that &lt;unk&gt; it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be. &lt;unk&gt; According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the &lt;unk&gt; and rushed Randy during the performance. It is alleged that the third time, security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head. &lt;unk&gt; However, it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than &lt;unk&gt;. Guitarist Willie &lt;unk&gt; said, &lt;unk&gt; I can &lt;unk&gt;t recall that particular show, let alone a fan being beaten on the stage. I think I would &lt;unk&gt;ve noticed something like that considering the &lt;unk&gt; thing. &lt;unk&gt; According to Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s attorney Martin &lt;unk&gt;, the police launched an investigation following the death of &lt;unk&gt;, about a month after the concert and following a coma. After interviewing several &lt;unk&gt; from the concert, the police asked the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Department of &lt;unk&gt;ustice to take part in the investigation ; however, they refused to cooperate and, &lt;unk&gt;, did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and charges &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe was arrested by the Czech police on suspicion of &lt;unk&gt;. Lamb of God was prepared to play in Prague on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, but Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s arrest upon arrival at &lt;unk&gt; Airport caused the concert to be canceled. According to T&lt;unk&gt; Nova, Blythe stated that he had not been aware of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death and expressed his remorse. A police spokesperson stated on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; that the police had formally charged Blythe under section &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Czech Criminal Code, which contains intentional &lt;unk&gt; of bodily harm resulting in death ( i.e. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. He faced &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; years of imprisonment if found guilty. Randy &lt;unk&gt;s brother Mark Blythe said the charge was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; and will be dropped immediately. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Court &lt;unk&gt; and bail &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the State Attorney brought a motion to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe in pre &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; trial detention, as he considered Blythe a flight risk. During a hearing conducted the same day, judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of the Prague &lt;unk&gt; District Court ruled that Blythe will be held on &lt;unk&gt;, with the possibility of a bail of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s alleged annual income ; Blythe was held in &lt;unk&gt; Prison. &lt;unk&gt; was deposited in the court &lt;unk&gt;s bank account on mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; day of &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by &lt;unk&gt; court, the Prague Municipal Court. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, Prague Municipal Court &lt;unk&gt;s panel of three judges headed by judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. After this, the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release, trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and &lt;unk&gt; or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; court rejected the State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s second complaint and ordered Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s immediate release. Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day, claiming in an interview with T&lt;unk&gt; Nova that he would return for the trial. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the spokesperson of the Prague State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s Office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe. After reviewing the case file, the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Two weeks later, a judge set the trial to commence on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days. Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person. The case was heard by a panel of the Prague Municipal Court, consisting of presiding professional judge Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and two lay judges. Trials in the Czech Republic are public. In general, the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the &lt;unk&gt; ; however, it is not bound by its legal assessment by the State Attorney. Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court, consisting of three professional judges. A decision of second instance court is final and &lt;unk&gt;. Nevertheless, an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney, which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in &lt;unk&gt; ; an extraordinary appeal may, however, rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case. After exhausting all of these &lt;unk&gt;, the defendant may also &lt;unk&gt; a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of &lt;unk&gt; Rights and Basic &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; State Attorney &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; against Blythe was brought by State Attorney &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; had tried a number of murderers, such as &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( life in prison &lt;unk&gt;, Roman &lt;unk&gt; ( life imprisonment at &lt;unk&gt;st instance, &lt;unk&gt; years on appeal &lt;unk&gt;, Maria &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; years imprisonment &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; years imprisonment &lt;unk&gt;. He also tried a case against &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting &lt;unk&gt; years in prison for ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted &lt;unk&gt; due to lack of evidence ; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different &lt;unk&gt; of the Municipal Court. Another of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s murder cases which ended in &lt;unk&gt; due to insufficient evidence is that of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a vice &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; chairman of the Czech Football Association. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Defense lawyers &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Randy Blythe was represented by Prague lawyers Martin &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; studied law at the Faculty of Law of Charles &lt;unk&gt;niversity and at the New York &lt;unk&gt;niversity. From &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, he served as external advisor of the then Prime Minister &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. A former partner at Baker &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; established &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Co. in &lt;unk&gt;. He is also a member of board of directors of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; gained fame as attorney of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a Kurdish national who was first charged in &lt;unk&gt; with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture. It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history, as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against &lt;unk&gt; until he was &lt;unk&gt; by the Municipal Court in Prague in &lt;unk&gt;. The court held that although the crimes did take place, there is no evidence that &lt;unk&gt; took part in it. He was also defending judge Pavel &lt;unk&gt;, who was indicted of accepting a &lt;unk&gt;. The proceedings ended with &lt;unk&gt; being found insane and &lt;unk&gt; not liable. &lt;unk&gt; also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a &lt;unk&gt; of Czech &lt;unk&gt; indicted on charges of rape and torture. During the proceedings, the judge sent &lt;unk&gt; to face the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived as &lt;unk&gt; behaviour bordering on contempt &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The trial started on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; told him that the club was terrible and &lt;unk&gt;. According to Blythe, the &lt;unk&gt; went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous. Blythe, who is &lt;unk&gt;, took off his glasses before entering the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan &lt;unk&gt; by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, &lt;unk&gt; rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to &lt;unk&gt; him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s collar, pushed him on the ground, &lt;unk&gt; on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw &lt;unk&gt; trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security. Later, when another fan tried to climb the stage, Blythe thought that it was &lt;unk&gt; again. Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, author of video which caught the previous incidents with &lt;unk&gt;, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him &lt;unk&gt; up. Blythe insisted that he never saw &lt;unk&gt; nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death. Blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris &lt;unk&gt;, Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s drummer, testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to &lt;unk&gt;, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage. Blythe also alleged that after learning about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, he had written a letter to the &lt;unk&gt; family, in which he offered help and a meeting in &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; person. Daniel &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s father, however, testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident. The &lt;unk&gt; family &lt;unk&gt;s representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;S &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, eight witnesses delivered their testimonies on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Among them were friends of Daniel &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and three friends had come to attend the concert from &lt;unk&gt;, a town in mountains some &lt;unk&gt; kilometres ( &lt;unk&gt; mi &lt;unk&gt; northwest of Prague. They described &lt;unk&gt; as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an &lt;unk&gt; from a guitar player before the concert had started. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s friend &lt;unk&gt;an &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; climbed the stage, and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage. He said he was &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sure Blythe pushed &lt;unk&gt; with both hands. &lt;unk&gt; He further said that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s behavior &lt;unk&gt; from all the concerts he had attended in the past, commenting that Blythe was visibly furious. He further claimed that &lt;unk&gt; was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe, with another fan being kicked, choked and receiving a punch from Blythe. &lt;unk&gt; corroborated Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s testimony that Blythe asked &lt;unk&gt; Are you okay? &lt;unk&gt; after &lt;unk&gt; fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as &lt;unk&gt; fell sick after the concert, they called him an ambulance. According to &lt;unk&gt;, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s other friend &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore. &lt;unk&gt; climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, &lt;unk&gt; fell directly on the ground. According to &lt;unk&gt;, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. &lt;unk&gt; further testified that after the fall, &lt;unk&gt; went to sit on a bench, where he was &lt;unk&gt; a water bottle. &lt;unk&gt; began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a &lt;unk&gt; at the back of his head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. &lt;unk&gt; said that he understood Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage. Another person to testify was Robert &lt;unk&gt;, who worked as a security guard the night of the incident. &lt;unk&gt; said that the &lt;unk&gt; was too close to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan &lt;unk&gt;s fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely. Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in &lt;unk&gt; and at the court. Among other things, one of the witnesses originally alleged that &lt;unk&gt; and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage ; however, at the court hearing, he testified that there was no prior contact between them. Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Milan &lt;unk&gt;, the fan whom Blythe admitted to &lt;unk&gt; off the stage, testified on the third day of the trial. &lt;unk&gt; said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. &lt;unk&gt; testified that Blythe knocked him down, &lt;unk&gt; on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not &lt;unk&gt; him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage. Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s fall at the end of the concert. The judge also read a sworn statement from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s former producer, who stated that she had not known about the incident. She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening, but learned about the reasons for that only later, during the police investigation. The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue, including that barriers should be placed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; metres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; from the stage. &lt;unk&gt; Tom&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; testified that although this was not the case, the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert. Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day. The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions. The judge went again through the Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s testimony and, with a view to the previous witness statements, asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan &lt;unk&gt; whom Blythe threw off the stage. Blythe responded by saying : &lt;unk&gt; To the best of my knowledge, it was Milan &lt;unk&gt; who was coming up &lt;unk&gt; on stage &lt;unk&gt; every time. &lt;unk&gt; Also that day, expert medical witness &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; took the stand. According to The Prague Post, &lt;unk&gt; testified that &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; added that the &lt;unk&gt; mortality rate from this kind of injury is around &lt;unk&gt; percent, and that doctors couldn &lt;unk&gt;t have done more to save the patient. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue, where the initial diagnosis took place. Since this hospital did not have a specialized &lt;unk&gt; department, &lt;unk&gt; was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis. There, &lt;unk&gt; underwent two operations, first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone. Finally, defense asked for &lt;unk&gt; as a key witness fell ill. The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day, after which the hearings would be &lt;unk&gt; until March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, in order to hear the defense &lt;unk&gt;s witness. Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, only one witness took the stand before the hearing was &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he &lt;unk&gt; didn &lt;unk&gt;t like the description of the situation &lt;unk&gt; by the previous witnesses. He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night, and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show. He also said that each time somebody got on the stage, Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there. &lt;unk&gt; testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive, somebody aided his fall from behind. He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground. &lt;unk&gt; had trouble recalling details from the show, as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in &lt;unk&gt;, and thus could not describe, among other things, the position of the &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The trial resumed on March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, appointed by the court &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, appointed by the defense &lt;unk&gt;. Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two &lt;unk&gt;. One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage. The ambulance arrived &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; minutes later. Another &lt;unk&gt; was a fan, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, who testified that she saw Blythe &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, saying &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; e climbed onto the stage, and when he tried to stand up, Blythe &lt;unk&gt; him. &lt;unk&gt; According to her, the &lt;unk&gt; was strong enough for &lt;unk&gt; to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment. She testified that &lt;unk&gt; fell backwards. Another &lt;unk&gt; of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Day &lt;unk&gt; of the trial &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; A defense &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; appointed expert witness in the field of &lt;unk&gt; testified on March &lt;unk&gt; that &lt;unk&gt; could not turn &lt;unk&gt; degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head. He further said that if &lt;unk&gt; fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, as well as some of the &lt;unk&gt; testimonies, according to which &lt;unk&gt; fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points. In his closing speech, the State Attorney asked the court to &lt;unk&gt; Blythe for &lt;unk&gt; years, claiming that &lt;unk&gt; even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury. &lt;unk&gt; A &lt;unk&gt; family representative said that based on the witness testimonies, the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible. He continued that he would not be &lt;unk&gt; the requested amount, as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered. He further added that Daniel had died on his father &lt;unk&gt;s birthday, and his mother has consequently become a &lt;unk&gt; patient unable to work. In his closing word, Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so. He further commented that in case of &lt;unk&gt;, measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; First instance verdict &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On March &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the court delivered a verdict, according to which Blythe was not &lt;unk&gt; liable for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s death, even though he had the moral responsibility for it. Consequently, the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s bail. The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown &lt;unk&gt; off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his &lt;unk&gt;, could have mistaken &lt;unk&gt; for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the &lt;unk&gt;. According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the &lt;unk&gt; and security members. &lt;unk&gt;udge &lt;unk&gt; further &lt;unk&gt; Blythe for not having met with the &lt;unk&gt; family. The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Appeals verdict &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The State Attorney &lt;unk&gt;s appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the Prague High Court, chaired by judge &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The hearing took place in Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s absence. Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; was upheld by the panel on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the Supreme Court. As the appeal hasn &lt;unk&gt;t been lodged by &lt;unk&gt; within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict, it has become final. In &lt;unk&gt; Blythe demanded ca &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; millions for damages but the Municipal Court for Prague &lt;unk&gt; dismissed the suit. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Reaction &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; In reaction to the arrest and detention, a fan created a petition at the official White House petition site. By the time Blythe was released on bail, it gathered over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; signatures. On &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God &lt;unk&gt;s hometown of Richmond, &lt;unk&gt;irginia, by a friend of Blythe &lt;unk&gt;s. At the event, &lt;unk&gt; ( who are also from Richmond &lt;unk&gt; frontman Dave &lt;unk&gt; said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested. I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up.... This stuff could have all been worked out &lt;unk&gt; or legally before he got there. ” In addition to &lt;unk&gt;, other notable figures in heavy metal, such as Tom Araya and David &lt;unk&gt;, have also come out in support of Blythe. In a post to his blog, Blythe explained that he met the &lt;unk&gt; family in private after the trial, and promised them to be &lt;unk&gt; a spokesperson for safer shows &lt;unk&gt;. He emphasized that the family never attacked him and &lt;unk&gt; just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son &lt;unk&gt;.  &lt;unk&gt; Hurricane &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hurricane &lt;unk&gt; was a Category &lt;unk&gt; hurricane that killed four people after &lt;unk&gt; the western coast of Mexico in &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; from an area of disturbed weather on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, several hundred miles south of Mexico, &lt;unk&gt; gradually intensified. &lt;unk&gt; latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. The following morning, &lt;unk&gt; attained winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; as it passed roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; dissipated over open waters. Prior to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the &lt;unk&gt; River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of &lt;unk&gt; were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in &lt;unk&gt; a severe drought. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meteorological history &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis. Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwestward. Gradually, convection consolidated around an area of low pressure. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a Tropical Cyclone Formation &lt;unk&gt; was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within &lt;unk&gt; hours. On the following day, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E by the National Hurricane Center at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;TC. &lt;unk&gt;pon being declared, the depression was located about &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, Mexico. However, after post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; analysis, the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier. &lt;unk&gt; a west &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment, characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;. Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt;, the second named storm of the season. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, convection increased markedly with several &lt;unk&gt; tops ( denoted by cloud &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; top temperatures below &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in &lt;unk&gt; outflow also took place. As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, &lt;unk&gt; acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a hurricane hunter aircraft found &lt;unk&gt; just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, a &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; wide eye developed within the central dense &lt;unk&gt;. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated &lt;unk&gt; to have attained winds of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; along with a barometric pressure of &lt;unk&gt; mbar ( hPa ; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; inHg &lt;unk&gt; ; however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of &lt;unk&gt; mph ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; h &lt;unk&gt; from the &lt;unk&gt;niversity of Wisconsin and the &lt;unk&gt; Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; south &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. &lt;unk&gt; later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system &lt;unk&gt;s structure, the NHC downgraded &lt;unk&gt; to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on &lt;unk&gt;. The storm &lt;unk&gt;s remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Preparations and impact &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; E on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between &lt;unk&gt; and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from &lt;unk&gt; de &lt;unk&gt; to Punta San &lt;unk&gt;. Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna. As &lt;unk&gt; continued to strengthen, the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. Early on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, the easternmost advisories were discontinued as &lt;unk&gt; moved away. Later that morning, all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s rapid weakening. In Colima and &lt;unk&gt;, residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;. In Colima, &lt;unk&gt; shelters were opened to the public. Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief. A total of &lt;unk&gt; temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, many of which were in Acapulco, as many residents were expected to evacuate flood &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; prone area. An orange &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains. Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( National Weather Service &lt;unk&gt; advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of &lt;unk&gt;. Across Guerrero, &lt;unk&gt; produced heavy rain, peaking at &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt; in &lt;unk&gt;, Guerrero. Several homes across the state were damaged, though none were destroyed. In Acapulco, &lt;unk&gt; homes were inundated by flood waters, prompting &lt;unk&gt; in areas built in &lt;unk&gt; to relocate residents after Hurricane Pauline. Several landslides blocked off roads and a &lt;unk&gt; m ( &lt;unk&gt; ft &lt;unk&gt; section of a roundabout was destroyed. In the community of &lt;unk&gt;, three people were killed after being washed away by flood waters. Heavy rains from &lt;unk&gt; caused the &lt;unk&gt; River to overflow its banks, placing &lt;unk&gt; homes across &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; under water. One person drowned in San Agust&lt;unk&gt;n after falling in the swollen river. Twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seven &lt;unk&gt; in and around the city lost power after muddy &lt;unk&gt; entered a &lt;unk&gt;. Throughout Oaxaca, at least a dozen homes lost their roofs due to high winds. &lt;unk&gt; of Colima, Chiapas, Michoac&lt;unk&gt;n and &lt;unk&gt; experienced heavy rains ; however, in many areas, the rain proved beneficial in &lt;unk&gt; a severe drought.  &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, Mississippi &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of Mississippi, in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States. It is the county seat of Lauderdale County and the principal city of the Meridian, Mississippi &lt;unk&gt; Statistical Area. Along major highways, the city is &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; east of &lt;unk&gt;ackson, Mississippi ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; west of Birmingham, Alabama ; &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana ; and &lt;unk&gt; mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; southeast of Memphis, Tennessee. Established in &lt;unk&gt;, at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi, Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s economy was built on the railways and goods transported on them, and it became a strategic trading center. During the American Civil War, General William &lt;unk&gt; Sherman burned much of the city to the ground in the Battle of Meridian ( February, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; after the war, the city entered a &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age &lt;unk&gt; it become the largest city in Mississippi between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, and a leading center for manufacturing in the South, with &lt;unk&gt; trains arriving and departing daily. &lt;unk&gt;nion Station, built in &lt;unk&gt;, is now a multi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; modal center, giving access to the Meridian Transit System, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;, averaging &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; passengers per year. Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry, the city has diversified, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people in &lt;unk&gt;. The population within the city limits, according to &lt;unk&gt; census estimates, is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, but a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people respectively are in the labor force, feed the economy of the city. The area is served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which provide over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; jobs. &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is home to the Regional Counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Academy ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state. Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in &lt;unk&gt;. The field is now home to the &lt;unk&gt;th Air &lt;unk&gt; Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the &lt;unk&gt; Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; military employer in the region, employing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people. Among the city &lt;unk&gt;s many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center, the Meridian Museum of Art, Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries, one for whites and one for African Americans. The Carnegie Branch Library, now demolished, was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern &lt;unk&gt;nited States during the segregation era. The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; Father of Country Music &lt;unk&gt;, was born in Meridian. Highland Park houses a museum which displays &lt;unk&gt; of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; engine era. The park is also home to the Highland Park &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a National Historic Landmark. It is the world &lt;unk&gt;s only two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; row stationary &lt;unk&gt; menagerie in existence. Other notable natives include Miss America &lt;unk&gt; Susan &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in &lt;unk&gt;, and Hartley &lt;unk&gt;, founder of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; headquartered in Meridian. The federal &lt;unk&gt; was the site of the &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; trial of suspects in the murder of &lt;unk&gt; and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Previously inhabited by the &lt;unk&gt; Native Americans, the area now called Meridian was obtained by the &lt;unk&gt;nited States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing &lt;unk&gt; Creek in &lt;unk&gt; during the period of Indian &lt;unk&gt;. After the treaty was ratified, European &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American settlers began to move into the area. After receiving a federal land grant of about &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt;, Richard &lt;unk&gt;, the first settler of Meridian, began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area. Most of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s land was bought in &lt;unk&gt; by Lewis A. &lt;unk&gt;, a lawyer from Alabama. &lt;unk&gt;ohn T. Ball, a merchant from &lt;unk&gt; County, bought the remaining &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; and Ball, now known as the founders of the city, began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections. There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement. Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, &lt;unk&gt; believing the term to be synonymous with &lt;unk&gt; junction &lt;unk&gt; ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( meaning &lt;unk&gt; mad river &lt;unk&gt; in a Native American language &lt;unk&gt;, from the name of a nearby creek ; and &lt;unk&gt; proposed &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; City. &lt;unk&gt; Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad &lt;unk&gt; the sign on which would alternate between &lt;unk&gt; Meridian &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; each day. Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left &lt;unk&gt; Meridian &lt;unk&gt; on the station permanently. The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in &lt;unk&gt;. Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war. During the Battle of Meridian in &lt;unk&gt;, General William &lt;unk&gt; Sherman led troops into the city, destroying the railroads in every direction, as well as an arsenal and immense &lt;unk&gt; ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground. Sherman is reported to have said afterwards, &lt;unk&gt; Meridian, with its depots, store &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; houses, arsenal, hospitals, offices, hotels, and &lt;unk&gt; no longer exists. &lt;unk&gt; Despite the destruction, the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired, back in operation &lt;unk&gt; working days after the battle. Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era, with the riot of &lt;unk&gt; following a fire that damaged many businesses. The town &lt;unk&gt; in the aftermath of the Civil War, and experienced its &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age &lt;unk&gt; from &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;. The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries, which caused a population boom. As the population rose, commercial activity increased in the downtown area. Between &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;, Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South. Many of the city &lt;unk&gt;s historic buildings were built during and just after this era, including the Grand Opera House in &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; School in &lt;unk&gt;, two Carnegie libraries in &lt;unk&gt;, and the &lt;unk&gt; Building, Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s tallest skyscraper, in &lt;unk&gt;. The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government &lt;unk&gt;s efforts to bring in &lt;unk&gt; new industrial plants in &lt;unk&gt; and a booming automobile industry in the &lt;unk&gt;s. Even through the stock market crash of &lt;unk&gt; and the following Great Depression, the city continued to attract new businesses. With &lt;unk&gt; becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression, the S. H. Kress &lt;unk&gt; Co. building, built to &lt;unk&gt; provide luxury to the common man, &lt;unk&gt; opened in downtown Meridian, as did the Temple Theater, which was used as a movie house. The federal &lt;unk&gt; was built in &lt;unk&gt; as a &lt;unk&gt; project. After a brief &lt;unk&gt; of the economy at the end of the Depression, the country entered World War II, which renewed the importance of railroads. The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles, so Meridian became the region &lt;unk&gt;s rail center again. This renewed prosperity continued until the &lt;unk&gt;s, when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails. The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses, resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas. During the American Civil Rights Movement in the &lt;unk&gt;s, Meridian was home to a Council of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; office and several other activist organizations. &lt;unk&gt;ames &lt;unk&gt; and other local residents, along with Michael &lt;unk&gt;, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from the North, worked to create a community center, holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote. Whites in the area resented the activism, and racial tension often resulted in violence. In &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, and Goodman went to &lt;unk&gt; County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam. Seven &lt;unk&gt;, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted in the federal &lt;unk&gt; in Meridian of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; the victims of their civil rights &lt;unk&gt; and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial. It was the first time that a white jury had convicted &lt;unk&gt; a white official in a civil rights killing. &lt;unk&gt; In &lt;unk&gt;, the case was reopened by the state, which brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray &lt;unk&gt; was convicted of &lt;unk&gt; and sentenced to &lt;unk&gt; years in prison. Meridian later honored &lt;unk&gt; by renaming a portion of &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the &lt;unk&gt;s and following the construction of highways that made &lt;unk&gt; easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt;s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic &lt;unk&gt; and Landmarks Commission was created in &lt;unk&gt;, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in &lt;unk&gt;. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to &lt;unk&gt; downtown, including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in &lt;unk&gt; based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s Golden Age ; it had been demolished. Other projects included the renovation of the &lt;unk&gt; Building in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Restaurant in &lt;unk&gt;, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in &lt;unk&gt; for use as the &lt;unk&gt; Mississippi State &lt;unk&gt;niversity Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts. &lt;unk&gt; After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late &lt;unk&gt;, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown &lt;unk&gt; effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the &lt;unk&gt; Building, but newly elected Mayor &lt;unk&gt; Barry killed the plans in early &lt;unk&gt;. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Hotels &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Given Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels. Even before Meridian reached its &lt;unk&gt; Golden Age, &lt;unk&gt; several large hotels, including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels, were built before the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century. With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original &lt;unk&gt;nion Station in &lt;unk&gt;, many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers. The &lt;unk&gt; Hotel was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;, and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;. Hotel Meridian was constructed in &lt;unk&gt;, and &lt;unk&gt;nion Hotel was built in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt;nion Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in &lt;unk&gt;, and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian &lt;unk&gt;rban Center Historic District. As the city grew, the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy, as evidenced by the eleven &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in &lt;unk&gt;. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in &lt;unk&gt;, the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building. In &lt;unk&gt; it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark. The &lt;unk&gt; Young Hotel was built in &lt;unk&gt;. A staple in the African &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American business district that developed west of the city &lt;unk&gt;s core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room. As the city suburbs developed in the &lt;unk&gt;s and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s, most hotels moved outside of downtown. &lt;unk&gt; of the Riley Center in &lt;unk&gt; has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel. The &lt;unk&gt; Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose, but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations. The &lt;unk&gt; Preservation Society was formed in &lt;unk&gt; to raise public awareness and support for the building &lt;unk&gt;s renovation, featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Historic districts &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meridian has nine historic districts that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Today, fewer than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;ews live in Meridian, most of whom are elderly. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Geography and climate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Meridian is located in the North Central Hills region of Mississippi in Lauderdale County. According to the &lt;unk&gt;nited States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is land and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq mi ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; km&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is water.

The area surrounding the city is covered with cotton and corn fields along with oak and pine forests, and its topography consists of clay hills and the bottom lands of the head waters of the &lt;unk&gt; River. The natural terrain of the area has been modified in the urban core of the city by &lt;unk&gt;, but it maintains its gentle rolling character in the outlying areas. Numerous small creeks are found throughout the city and small lakes and woodlands lie in the northern and southern portions of the city. &lt;unk&gt; Creek runs through the southern portion of the city and branches off into Gallagher &lt;unk&gt;s Creek, which flows through the center of the city. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s Creek runs through the far &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; western part of the city while smaller creeks including Shearer &lt;unk&gt;s Branch, Magnolia Creek, and &lt;unk&gt; Creek are dispersed throughout the city. Meridian is in the humid subtropical climate zone. The average high temperature during summer ( &lt;unk&gt;une through August &lt;unk&gt; is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt; and the average low is around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; F ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; C &lt;unk&gt;.

The average annual precipitation in the city is &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt;. Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, and the wettest month of the year is March, in which an average of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in ( &lt;unk&gt; mm &lt;unk&gt; of rain falls. Much rainfall is delivered by thunderstorms which are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year. Severe thunderstorms - which can produce damaging winds and &lt;unk&gt; or large hail in addition to the usual &lt;unk&gt; of lightning and heavy rain - occasionally occur. These are most common during the spring months with a secondary peak during the Fall months. These storms also bring the risk of tornadoes. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Economy &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Early on, the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the &lt;unk&gt;th century, with five major rail lines and &lt;unk&gt; trains coming in and out daily. The city &lt;unk&gt;s economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about &lt;unk&gt; through &lt;unk&gt;. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the &lt;unk&gt; industry in the &lt;unk&gt;s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people. Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in &lt;unk&gt; by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April &lt;unk&gt;, the city &lt;unk&gt;s civilian labor force was only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people, there is a population of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; mile ( &lt;unk&gt; km &lt;unk&gt; radius, of which &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. &lt;unk&gt; percent of Lauderdale County &lt;unk&gt;s workers reside in the county while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; live within &lt;unk&gt; miles. In April &lt;unk&gt;, there were &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Hospital is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and Anderson Hospital with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. There are three hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; related facilities. &lt;unk&gt;eff Anderson Regional Medical Center provides &lt;unk&gt; surgery, a Level II newborn intensive &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; care unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a &lt;unk&gt; Hospital of Meridian, which offers long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term care for non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Riley Hospital has two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since &lt;unk&gt;. Retail is another major employer in the county, with &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people employed in April &lt;unk&gt;. Nearly &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city.

Phase I of the construction of Meridian Crossroads, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; square &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; foot ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; shopping center in the &lt;unk&gt; Lakes area, was completed in November &lt;unk&gt;, providing a major boost to retail in the area. Also, the shopping district on North Hills Street has continued to expand, and in March &lt;unk&gt;, additional retail and office space was opened near the Highway &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The area is also served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which supply over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; jobs to residents of the surrounding area. &lt;unk&gt; Meridian provides training for naval carrier pilots and other enlisted personnel. Also housed at the base is the Regional Counter &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Training Academy ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, which provides &lt;unk&gt; training for law enforcement in many southeastern states. &lt;unk&gt; the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state, the city is the leader in a nine county regional response team and a twenty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; nine county regional response task force. Key Field is the site of the famous flight by brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in &lt;unk&gt;.

One of the first art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February &lt;unk&gt;. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in &lt;unk&gt;, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt;th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in &lt;unk&gt; and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes &lt;unk&gt;th and &lt;unk&gt;th century portraits, &lt;unk&gt;th century photography, and several sculptures. The Meridian Council for the Arts ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; was founded as Meridian &lt;unk&gt;s and Lauderdale County &lt;unk&gt;s official arts agency in &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual &lt;unk&gt; Festival, several workshops, and other special events each year. &lt;unk&gt; is partnered with many arts organizations in the city and county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South &lt;unk&gt;s oldest subscription &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; based community theatres, was built in &lt;unk&gt; and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; guests each season, making it Mississippi &lt;unk&gt;s most &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; attended community theatre.

In &lt;unk&gt; the &lt;unk&gt; booked its first international soloist, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District develop its own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox &lt;unk&gt;, who has been with the orchestra since &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; will celebrate its &lt;unk&gt;th anniversary in February &lt;unk&gt; with a performance from &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The city &lt;unk&gt;s former Grand Opera House was built in &lt;unk&gt; by two half brothers, Israel Marks and Levi &lt;unk&gt;. During its operation the opera house hosted many famous artists and works, the first being a German company &lt;unk&gt;s rendition of &lt;unk&gt;ohann &lt;unk&gt; II &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; The &lt;unk&gt; Baron &lt;unk&gt;. After closing in the late &lt;unk&gt;s due to the Great Depression, the opera house was abandoned for nearly &lt;unk&gt; years. A &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million grant in &lt;unk&gt; by the Riley Foundation, a local foundation chartered in &lt;unk&gt;, sparked the building &lt;unk&gt;s restoration while &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million came from a combination of city, county, and federal grants. The opera house &lt;unk&gt;s renovation was completed in September &lt;unk&gt; under the new name &lt;unk&gt; Mississippi State &lt;unk&gt;niversity Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts. &lt;unk&gt; The Riley Center, which includes a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seat auditorium for live performances, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; seat studio theater, and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; sq ft ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; m&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; of meeting space, attracts more than &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; visitors to downtown Meridian annually for conferences, meetings, and performances. Meridian is rightly considered an architectural treasure &lt;unk&gt; being one the nations most intact cities from the turn of the last century. Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their &lt;unk&gt; due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the &lt;unk&gt;S south designed by noted Canadian born &lt;unk&gt; Louis S. &lt;unk&gt;, famous for &lt;unk&gt; the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed &lt;unk&gt; Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco &lt;unk&gt; in the &lt;unk&gt;S and is often compared to Detroit &lt;unk&gt;s famed Fisher Building. Noted California &lt;unk&gt; Wallace &lt;unk&gt; designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which &lt;unk&gt; the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive where his &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon &lt;unk&gt;, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph &lt;unk&gt;. One &lt;unk&gt; work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in &lt;unk&gt; and another in Marion Park burned in the &lt;unk&gt;s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and &lt;unk&gt;erde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the &lt;unk&gt;s and originally had &lt;unk&gt; lighting which was removed sadly during a &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; and which are now in private residences on &lt;unk&gt; Springs Drive and in North Hills. Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Mississippi Legislature approved the idea in &lt;unk&gt; and in &lt;unk&gt; promised &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million in funding if private contributors could raise &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; million. The city donated &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to the cause in September &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt;, as proposed, would be located on &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt; at &lt;unk&gt; Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre, an indoor concert hall, and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists. The Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana &lt;unk&gt;s building. That property and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt; for &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. In February &lt;unk&gt;, the &lt;unk&gt; revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame. The first star on the walk was dedicated to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, a Meridian native. In September of the same year, the second star was revealed, recognizing &lt;unk&gt; King, a famous blues musician from Mississippi. On &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, authors Tennessee Williams, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and William Faulkner were added to the walk. &lt;unk&gt; Ward was added to the walk on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The &lt;unk&gt; plans to add many more Mississippi &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; born stars to the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include Morgan Freeman, &lt;unk&gt;immy &lt;unk&gt;, Elvis Presley, Conway &lt;unk&gt;, and others. Another location in the city used for large productions is the &lt;unk&gt; Shrine Temple Theater. The Temple Theater houses a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; pipe Robert Morgan organ, one of two Theater &lt;unk&gt; still in their original installations in the state. With seating for &lt;unk&gt; persons, the silent movie era was a prosperous time for the Temple. At the time, it was one of the largest stages in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. Today, seating &lt;unk&gt; persons, the Temple is used year &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; round for area events, live stage shows, plays, concerts, &lt;unk&gt; Shrine functions, and public screenings of classic movies. Highland Park houses a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; museum which displays the original guitar of &lt;unk&gt; The Singing &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and other &lt;unk&gt; of his life and career, as well as railroad equipment from the steam &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; engine era. In addition to the museum building itself, there are outside memorials, and a vintage steam &lt;unk&gt; on display. A Mississippi Blues Trail historic marker has been placed in Meridian to honor the city as the birthplace of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and emphasizes his importance to the development of the blues style of music in Mississippi. The city was the first site to receive this designation outside the Mississippi Delta. Also, a Mississippi Country Music Trail marker was placed in Oak Grove Cemetery in honor of &lt;unk&gt; on &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. Each year since &lt;unk&gt;, the city has held a festival during May to honor the anniversary of his death. The park is also home to a &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century &lt;unk&gt; manufactured around &lt;unk&gt; by Gustav &lt;unk&gt; of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Highland Park &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; has been in operation since &lt;unk&gt;, is a National Historic Landmark, and is the world &lt;unk&gt;s only two &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; row stationary &lt;unk&gt; menagerie in existence. Its house is the only remaining original &lt;unk&gt; building built from a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. Around Town &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; is a public arts project of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; horses, representing the historic &lt;unk&gt;. Sixty &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; two pieces have been sponsored by local businesses and citizens, and design of the horses was conceived and painted by local artists. They are placed throughout the city and county. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Recreation &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The city contains several recreational parks, including Highland Park, &lt;unk&gt; Lakes, and &lt;unk&gt; Lake.

The games are held at several sports parks, including Northeast Park, &lt;unk&gt; Davidson Complex, and other various fields throughout the city.

The airport, which has been in service since &lt;unk&gt;, offers daily flights to Dallas &lt;unk&gt; Fort Worth, &lt;unk&gt;. During the Great Depression, residents of the city contemplated abandoning the airport because of the cost of maintenance, but in &lt;unk&gt; Brothers Fred and Al Key, managers of the airport, thought of a way to keep the airport operating. From &lt;unk&gt;une &lt;unk&gt; until &lt;unk&gt;uly &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;, the brothers flew over the city in their plane, the &lt;unk&gt; Ole Miss. &lt;unk&gt; The record they established in their &lt;unk&gt; days &lt;unk&gt;, totaling &lt;unk&gt; hours and &lt;unk&gt; minutes, attracted enough publicity and funds to the city to keep the airport running. Key Field is therefore named after the brothers, whose flight endurance record remains unbroken in conventional flight. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Highways &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Interstate Highways Interstate &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; west through &lt;unk&gt;ackson, Mississippi, eventually terminating near Kent, Texas, and east through Tuscaloosa, Alabama, eventually terminating in Florence, South Carolina.

From &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt;, trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors, which had authority to operate the schools. Although there were several schools in the city before &lt;unk&gt;, they were privately owned and only enrolled about &lt;unk&gt; students. The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September &lt;unk&gt;. The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church. The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in &lt;unk&gt;anuary &lt;unk&gt; to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district, and in March of the same year &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools. From this bond, the &lt;unk&gt; School was built in &lt;unk&gt;, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks. From this early district and later additions, the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size, which now includes six elementary schools, &lt;unk&gt; middle schools, and &lt;unk&gt; high schools. The city also contains several private schools including Lamar School, &lt;unk&gt; Christian School, Community Christian School, and St. Patrick &lt;unk&gt;s Catholic School. The campus of Meridian High School, the main high school in the district, occupies &lt;unk&gt; acres ( &lt;unk&gt; ha &lt;unk&gt;, including six buildings and &lt;unk&gt; classrooms. The school is made up of grades &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; approximately &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; students. Meridian is home to two post &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; secondary educational institutions. Meridian Community College, founded in &lt;unk&gt;, is located at &lt;unk&gt; Highway &lt;unk&gt; N and offers free tuition for four &lt;unk&gt; to graduates from the Meridian Public and Lauderdale County School &lt;unk&gt; as well as &lt;unk&gt; children who reside inside Lauderdale County. Originally known as Meridian &lt;unk&gt;unior College and located at Meridian High School, the college moved to its present location in &lt;unk&gt;. After &lt;unk&gt; laws were passed, &lt;unk&gt; merged with &lt;unk&gt; Harris &lt;unk&gt;unior College in &lt;unk&gt;, which had previously enrolled African &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American students. The name change from Meridian &lt;unk&gt;unior College to Meridian Community College took place In &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to more accurately reflect the diversity of opportunities it provides for a growing community area. &lt;unk&gt; Mississippi State &lt;unk&gt;niversity also operates a campus in the city. As of the Fall &lt;unk&gt; semester, &lt;unk&gt; students from &lt;unk&gt; counties throughout the state and several in Alabama attended the college. Meridian is served by the Meridian &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Lauderdale County Public Library, located at the corner of &lt;unk&gt;th Street and &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue. The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the &lt;unk&gt; Book and Magazine Club in the &lt;unk&gt;s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at &lt;unk&gt;th Street and &lt;unk&gt;th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until &lt;unk&gt;, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of &lt;unk&gt;, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in &lt;unk&gt;, and the former African &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; American library was demolished on May &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt;. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Media &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; The only daily newspaper printed in the city is The Meridian Star, which has been in operation since &lt;unk&gt;.

German authorities estimate that there are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; active Scientologists in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Church of Scientology has encountered particular &lt;unk&gt; from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal, social and cultural position in Germany. German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or &lt;unk&gt; community, and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions. The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization &lt;unk&gt;s activities. The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion. It views it as an abusive business &lt;unk&gt; as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution. This stance has been criticized, most notably by the &lt;unk&gt;.S. government, which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect &lt;unk&gt;. Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; sect &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to expose a prospective business partner &lt;unk&gt;s or employee &lt;unk&gt;s association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late &lt;unk&gt;, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Background &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology, founded in the early &lt;unk&gt;s in the &lt;unk&gt;nited States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in &lt;unk&gt; countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement. Its stated &lt;unk&gt; aim is to &lt;unk&gt; clear the planet &lt;unk&gt;, to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches that the source of people &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; lies in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, psychological &lt;unk&gt; acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of &lt;unk&gt; called &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; made available by the Church of Scientology. The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for &lt;unk&gt; and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments &lt;unk&gt; it as a profit &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; making enterprise rather than as a religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is &lt;unk&gt; a business &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; driven, &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, totalitarian ideology with world &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; dominating aspirations &lt;unk&gt;, and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought &lt;unk&gt; lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful &lt;unk&gt; Scientology has gained recognition as a tax &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in &lt;unk&gt; and the &lt;unk&gt;nited States in &lt;unk&gt;, and in &lt;unk&gt; won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which &lt;unk&gt; Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion. The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a &lt;unk&gt; commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism &lt;unk&gt; whose &lt;unk&gt; totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany &lt;unk&gt;s democratic society &lt;unk&gt;. Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October &lt;unk&gt;, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether. Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the &lt;unk&gt;K. On the subject of Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s status as a religion, the German government has pointed to a &lt;unk&gt; decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany. That court, noting Hubbard &lt;unk&gt;s instruction that Scientologists should &lt;unk&gt; make money, make more money &lt;unk&gt; make other people produce so as to make more money &lt;unk&gt;, came to the conclusion that &lt;unk&gt; Scientology &lt;unk&gt; to be a &lt;unk&gt; church &lt;unk&gt; merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests &lt;unk&gt;. In the same decision, the court also found that Scientology uses &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and totalitarian practices &lt;unk&gt;. Given the lessons of Germany &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt;th &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; century history, in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings, Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power. &lt;unk&gt; in Scientology writings to the elimination of &lt;unk&gt; parasites &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s &lt;unk&gt; world &lt;unk&gt; without &lt;unk&gt;, without criminals and without war &lt;unk&gt; evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism, and have led to Scientology being classified as an &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; political movement &lt;unk&gt;. To further justify its stance, the German government has also pointed to the long history of &lt;unk&gt;.S. court cases involving Scientology, including the conviction of &lt;unk&gt; top Scientologists in &lt;unk&gt; and &lt;unk&gt; for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of &lt;unk&gt;.S. government agencies, &lt;unk&gt; and the theft of government documents, a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; environment &lt;unk&gt;, and Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators. In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are &lt;unk&gt; structured so as to make the individual &lt;unk&gt; and financially dependent on a Scientology system &lt;unk&gt;, and that members often abandon contact with friends and family. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; History &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology presence in Germany &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientology first became active in Germany in &lt;unk&gt;. By &lt;unk&gt;, there were ten major centres ( &lt;unk&gt; Scientology Churches &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, as well as fourteen minor centres ( &lt;unk&gt; Scientology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; in Germany. The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities &lt;unk&gt; Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, D&lt;unk&gt;sseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hanover and &lt;unk&gt;. Of the Scientology &lt;unk&gt;, nine are in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, and three in &lt;unk&gt;. Following German re &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;, &lt;unk&gt; and North &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; Rhine &lt;unk&gt;. Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or &lt;unk&gt; in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Germany &lt;unk&gt;s domestic intelligence service, the &lt;unk&gt; f&lt;unk&gt;r &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt;, or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution &lt;unk&gt;, estimates that there are &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; to &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;. The Church of Scientology reported around &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; members from the mid &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt;,&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; members. &lt;unk&gt; in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of &lt;unk&gt; bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred. Scientology formulated a &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; Germany &lt;unk&gt; strategy in &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world &lt;unk&gt; with the long &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; term aim of transforming German society in line with the &lt;unk&gt; ideal : a non &lt;unk&gt;-&lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; society in which Scientology enjoys &lt;unk&gt; influence. The programme sought to address Scientology &lt;unk&gt;s image problems in Germany, to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain, such as Germany &lt;unk&gt;s National Socialist history, and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society, with a special emphasis on &lt;unk&gt; Scientologists into key positions in ind</td>\n",
